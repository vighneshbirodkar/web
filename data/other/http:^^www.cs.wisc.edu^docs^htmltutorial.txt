date mon nov gmt server ncsa content type text html last modified thu oct gmt content length introduction html introduction html written kurt revis modified steven fought document introduction html hypertext markup language vast majority documents seen web written using html html intended structural markup language traditional word processor desktop publishing program indicate want different parts document look structural publishing system indicate different parts document elsewhere outside document indicate element shown user case html browser decides render html elements original developers html wanted browsers developed wide variety systems kept simple tried avoid including elements made assumptions web user computer ability display pictures visually oriented tags html simply added browsers developers since become popular important understand html designed specify structure document visual appearance might like document show point times double spaced inch margins sides kinds decisions made person reading document tags html files plain text tags mixed formatting tags used like h operating systems h tags usually come pairs called containers surround pieces text tags made tag name first tag h called start tag text inside operating systems called content second tag h called end tag h tag signifies content text displayed header means level largest viewed browser netscape lynx whatever line look like operating systems although tags work way tags end tags example p tag specifying beginning paragraph doesn need p end paragraph discuss tag others later document tag names case sensitive h h equivalent tags may also optional attributes modify interpretation tag example img tag tells browser display image src attribute specify image name align atttribute specify alignment compared surrounding text attributes tag might used like img src os gif align top structure html file html files follow general format html head title title document title head body body main text document body html first tag html indicates contents file fact html format good idea enclose whole file html html although strictly required right although documents may interpreted correctly browsers currently use may change future html file split two parts header marked head head body marked body body text file enclosed within tags header specifies information document general usually used specify title title title title usually displayed top screen example document title introduction html note automatically display large line beginning use h body actual text document goes note html character line spacing unimportant example could written example html head title title document title head body body main text document body html gotten result note huge number documents web written strict html often head section completely missing mosaic became popular ncsa documentation stress proper construction many people used learn html emphasis using html correctly creating documents looked good mosaic forgiving bad html result many documents look good mosaic bad many browsers holds true netscape msie support encourage wide variety features outside html spec paragraphs spaces one problems beginners html spaces tabs newlines known collectively white space equivalent type test test test always shown browser test adding blank line document start new paragraph make paragraph use p tag beginning paragraph example p first paragraph babbles never really going anywhere p second paragraph however little weird short lines instance also lines seem go forever fact rather long extending characters decidedly finite scope also contains blank lines middle html rendered first paragraph babbles never really going anywhere second paragraph however little weird short lines instance also lines seem go forever fact rather long extending characters decidedly finite scope also contains blank lines middle related p br hr tags br produces line break without extra vertical space p puts hr inserts horizontal rule line extending across page section headings common html tags section headings like h tag used earlier fact whole range tags h top level headings h bottom tags tell browser use different type size indentation color heading level h heading level h heading level h heading level h heading level h heading level h tags denote section numbers see chapter section section levels course use section level tag document type styles html allows use number different type styles useful em adding emphasis like strong stronger emphasis browsers may display text italics bold characters underlined capital letters asterisks around general best use em strong since give good results browsers need however use produces italics b produces bold text also typewriter style like produced tt tag entities entities names start end represent characters cannot normally written ascii characters used markup example angle bracket characters used tags avoid ambiguities codes lt gt used produce respectively similarly ampersand character produced amp semicolon end code necessary codes include quot produces double quote character m sure code necessary ve never seen browser get confused character characters iso latin set also expressed cern provides table codes example produce u umlaut uuml code used another useful structure html comment produced contents comment displayed browser however versions mosaic broken still interpret tags within comments comment tags unfortunate example text right comment appear comment lists lists useful construct html three types lists ordered unordered descriptive ordered lists produce list numbered items make ordered list use ol ordered list li list item tags like ol li get two slices bread peanut butter jelly li spread jelly one side one slice bread li spread peanut butter side slice li put sandwich together eat ol result get two slices bread peanut butter jelly spread jelly one side one slice bread spread peanut butter side slice put sandwich together eat see items automatically numbered order unordered lists similar aren numbered instead ol ol use ul ul example bread two slices jelly peanut butter descriptive lists little different used giving lists items descriptions like dictionary tag descriptive lists predictably dl item dt term defined dd definition tag example make usage clear dl dt first term defined dd definition term dt piz za pe se dd open pie made typically thinly rolled bread dough spread spiced mixture tomatoes cheese ground meat baked dl first term defined definition term piz za pe se open pie made typically thinly rolled bread dough spread spiced mixture tomatoes cheese ground meat baked different kinds lists limited short items fact long want even multiple paragraphs example really long items list text go quite time really get idea next sentence new paragraph started p surprising eh another paragraph blank space separating previous text still indented correctly item nothing previous item though pictures adding pictures html document difficult picture must gif format filename ends gif file format make gif file using utility xv pbm programs include image use img tag usage little different tags seen far img tag nothing must use src attribute tag specify name image inside quotes src insert url image example picture felix img src felix gif picture felix default text lined bottom picture using align middle align top attributes change instance felix center things img src felix gif align middle felix center things felix img src felix gif align top top world felix top world another important attribute add img tags alt browser capable displaying graphics instead show text put inside quotes lynx text browser example page would incomprehensible without pictures good idea use alternative img src felix gif alt felix quite skier quite skier links full explanation create links documents beyond scope document however give quick introduction links sometimes referred anchors specified tag like img tag nothing href attribute specifies url link points click href link html see file link html click see file link html see text inside tags marked link create link using url put url href part anchor example link original html source uwcs home page href http www cs wisc edu uwcs home page another attribute name attribute attibute specifies text within anchor associated name links may jump directly anchor specifying theurl name target example might surround heading chapter book anchor name chapter chapter three anywhere else document could provide link chapter writing href chapter jump chapter felix book url http www cs wisc edu felix book html document could jump chapter book specifying href http www cs wisc edu felix book html chapter chapter felix book tags number tags less useful quick survey pre preformatted text rendered monospace font unlike html white space significant tags still honored though style useful tables information since tabs work listing similar pre smaller size meant program listings supposedly embedded tags ignored blockquote indented text meant long quotes material address address formatting different browsers give different results use br code multiple lines tags useful since one seems know exactly used dfn definition cite citation code html codes kbd keys keyboard like return samp sample codes var variable names sources information good idea html able create html documents want see links complete sources information might want read documents
