proceedings third international workshop multi strategy learning pp harpers ferry wv may msl approaches learning control information planning systems use explanation based learning generate control rules unfortunately ebl alone often produces overly complex rules actually decrease planning efficiency paper presents novel learning approach control knowledge acquisition integrates explanation

planning domains integrating explanation based inductive learning techniques acquire search control planning tara estlin ph d proposal department computer sciences university texas austin planning systems become important tool automating wide variety tasks control knowledge guides planner find solutions quickly crucial efficient planning domains machine learning techniques enable planning system automatically acquire domain specific search control knowledge different applications past approaches learning control information usually employed explanation based learning ebl generate control rules unfortunately ebl alone often produces overly complex rules actually decrease rather improve overall planning efficiency paper presents novel learning approach control knowledge

refinements scope one systems address learning control information newer partial order planners specifically proposal describes scope learns domain specific control rules ucpop planning algorithm resulting system shown produce significant speedup two different planning domains effective pure ebl approach future research performed three main areas first scope learning algorithm extended include additional techniques constructive induction rule utility analysis second scope thoroughly tested several real world planning domains identified possible testbeds depth comparisons drawn scope competing approaches third scope implemented different planning system order test portability planning algorithms work demonstrate machine learning techniques powerful tool quest tractable real world

automated generation image processing procedures lmcoa intelligent system assistance antenna operations first describe existing planning representation must enhanced represent reason aspects plans besides goal achievement resource usage quality execution time flexibility generality second planning systems must able fit wide range operational contexts planning tasks cannot completely automated therefore minimum plans produced must easily understandable modifiable users cases user must intimately involved plan construction process third planning systems must able compare favorably terms software lifecycle costs means automation scripts rule based expert systems means development intelligent tools environments facilitate knowledge acquisition validation maintenance prime importance hope description elucidation issues lead increased work areas
