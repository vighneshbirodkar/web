evaluates new solution interesting problem simple statement two parts research proposes evaluates new solution simply stating idea writing program research evaluation must evaluate idea become research evaluation take many forms example suppose develop new method detecting scene breaks video sequence evaluate idea implementing compare results algorithm realistic video sequences existing algorithm comparison might compare runtime performance quality result accurately detect scene breaks might compare results algorithm best results one human produces another example evaluation designing large system implementing discussing tradeoffs system design experience papers valuable system builders sometimes rarely idea novel enough simply stating causes new way looking things research hard thing sell however better earth shaking interesting problem tell interesting clearly subjective good metric ask many people want know answer problem p b medawar wrote advice young
