program people minor problems getting string class work interpreting particular error message however others claim completely lost cannot figure approach problem writing program play hangman maybe didn prepare properly assignment think terribly hard assignment may rushed material string class decided write detailed document describing assignment much code need use program given right assemble coherent structure fill details note code document address small problem treating upper lower case letters instead treats two versions letter totally different letters correct behavior assignment though responsible modifying program handle upper lower case letters user guesses letter e either upper lower case program reveal letters e secret phrase upper lower case however recommend rest program working basic implementation one way implement hangman game keep two strings secret phrase partially revealed secret phrase secret phrase initialized beginning program doesn change partially revealed secret phrase secret phrase letters blanked user guesses letter secret phrase corresponding letter partially revealed secret phrase unblanked example say secret phrase howdy doody partially revealed secret phrase contain string letters replaced underscore character user guesses letter o partially revealed secret phrase modified o secret phrase howdy doody corresponding character partially revealed secret phrase changed underscore character letter o pseudo code get random secret phrase initialize partially revealed phrase initialize number chances display partially revealed secret phrase initialize guessed letters empty string loop chances secret phrase guessed ask user guess letter error letter else already guessed error already guessed else add guess string guessed letters guess secret phrase message good guess reveal matching letters partially revealed phrase else message bad guess subtract one number chances display partially revealed secret phrase secret phrase guessed message congratulations else message sorry secret phrase secret phrase get random secret phrase program get random secret phrase calling function random secret phrase function following prototype string random secret phrase prototype tells us random secret phrase function inputs returns outputs string call function simply putting empty pair parentheses name random secret phrase however wrote line program would call function throw away return value definitely want general must use return value function way random secret phrase return value string randomly selected list appropriate thing string store variable refer value whenever need string secret phrase random secret phrase creates variable secret phrase type string initializes value returned random secret phrase function call initialize partially revealed secret phrase partially revealed secret phrase secret phrase letters changed underscores non letters space character punctuation left decide character letter us isalpha function function declared header file ctype h following prototype bool isalpha char ch prototype tells us isalpha function takes one input character returns boolean value true false given character letter returns true string partial phrase secret phrase int partial phrase length isalpha partial phrase partial phrase code loops characters partially revealed secret phrase character letter changed underscore since know number characters partially revealed secret phrase partial phrase length use simple counting loop use bracket operator access character index variable tells us character working checking whether letter already guessed decide user guessed letter previously need keep track letters already guessed done string holds previously guessed letters beginning game empty string time user guesses new letter add end string decide whether letter already guessed use function char string function following prototype bool char string char ch string str tells us function two inputs one character one string returns boolean e true false value returns true one characters given string character ch call function supply inputs guess string previously guessed letters tell whether guess made function call look like char string guess guessed letters usual need something return value function since char string returns boolean value use return value condition statement char string guess guessed letters add guess string guessed letters guessed letters guess remember shorthand following guessed letters guessed letters guess character guess automatically converted string operator concatenates two strings single string checking guess secret phrase step similar checking whether guess made previously use char string function instead searching string previously guessed characters search secret phrase char string guess secret phrase reveal matching letters secret phrase user guesses letter secret phrase must unblank correct letters partially revealed secret phrase changing guessed letter looping character secret phrase character guess reveal corresponding character partially revealed secret phrase changing underscore corresponding character secret phrase int checking whether game game ends either player run chances completely guessed secret phrase first condition checked boolean expression num chances second condition checked comparing secret phrase partially revealed secret phrase player won game checked boolean expression secret phrase partial phrase game ends either two boolean expressions true num chances secret phrase partial phrase however game must continue long neither conditions true thus condition loop would num chances secret phrase partial phrase mbirk cs wisc edu
