course covering broad range computer science concepts techniques including data abstraction recursion program correctness generic functions object oriented programming pattern matching languages evaluators use dylan language object oriented dynamic language developed apple computer well suited covering broad range introductory computer science topics course dylan language happens notation chosen writing programs major goals course teach students think clearly programs programming provide toolbox modern programming techniques applicable language course take students often wonder whether take cs cs cs focuses programming skills object oriented language java whereas cs provides exposure broad range computational programming problems using number programming paradigms including functional object oriented imperative programming techniques good cs background good formal skills e g mathematics physics probably take cs transfers cs cs either direction encouraged first two weeks reaching us best way reach course staff posting questions comments using cs web site http www cs cornell edu info courses current cs site contains course materials runs conote server allows students

assigned readings well covered lectures recitations six problem sets two preliminary exams final exam schedule given problem set combination written exercises programming assignment course grades based combination problem sets exam scores problem sets account approximately one half total grade late assignments accepted generally grade assignments immediately return following class period try complete programming assignments early accept late work best use time machine time think problems sitting computer matter many times say takes long time sink think problems sitting computer policy joint work much learning course comes programming problems may work jointly one person assignments two people work together however work together someone must submit single joint assignment names circumstances may hand work done someone else name doubt credit person got help would amazed easy tell people work together problem sets please make life unpleasant us breaking rules public lab
