hundred thousand particles however moving changing n squared particles per frame animation take long simplification needed make system develop quickly easily justified arrived examining real systems systems concerned particle dependency neighbors usually proportional less inverse square distance neighbor thousands particles within system likely much less hundred particles actually contribute significantly motion energy level particle thus determine significant contribution distance average particle contribution less significant particles within distance problem simplified determine particles within distance without information given particles would still n squared operation therefore logical introduce model concept bins space divided regularly spaced equal volume bins particle put bin corresponding location space thus two large lists one list particles arranged set bins containing pointers appropriate particle ideally bin would dimension least size distance whereby particle judged possibly significant contribution determine contributions neighbors particle x program would need search particles within bin particle x particles within immediately neighboring bins deal particles located near boundaries bin since particles within threshold distance guaranteed within space searched particle x guaranteed modified significant contributors though would work impractical implement due memory limitations ideal bin size would generally three four times size particle however account places particle might move progression life large percentage bins time empty given fact dimensions must bins allocated result large numbers bins instance taking hundred bins per dimension results need million bins bins particles hundred bins would also inefficient many parts particle system large densities particles lists searched would hundreds per particle negating effectiveness using bins therefore larger number bins necessary using bins would quickly exhaust resources almost computer solve problem must simplify model even losing much accuracy could obtained previous methods bin allowed hold number particles temperature important data element instead containing variable size list particles within bin contains set small number informational elements results loss alot useful information result rough approximations lose accuracy earlier models however interdependent reactions still possible information available particle local region space immediately neighboring areas space problem transformed one searching thousands particles one communication accuracy

number number less ths number particle dies happen opposite way well fire particle moves bin populated water particles extinguish well water particles also need know state water particles moved also killed appropriate situtation byproduct fact probabilities used kill particles bin counts accurate average time passes however local error changes system based error could accumulate therefore necessary recount number particles type end movement phase ways doubles time required animate interacting particle system still linear time better n squared thus steps required interact particle

system move type particles type particles moved type particle notes final state results though presented method solves many problems difficult side step particular conservation momentum difficult maintain simulating collision easily done using probabilistic method closely approximating reality done every bin particle moves however collision occurs particle affected unless message passing used source particle problem encountered research either side stepped ignoring interim bins completely done research perhaps damping factor applied proportionate number collisions might occurred another difficulty even parameters must tweaked place produce image approximates reality doesn approximate alterante reality flames progress upwards defined bands instance implementation interdependent fire system investigated seen results fire particle system image originally created particle system attempted use particles provided mpeg particles created frames created particles already died image rendered using dx color map opacity map animation took approximately minutes create running risc processor mb memory however noticed due bin limitations many particles go unused essentially slightly particles used using particles due current initialization sequence program slightly less full animation produced comparable original takes minutes create provided animation particle temperature based number particles within region space motion vector determined based upon density particles immediately within space well bins immediately neighbor space damping factor applied motion plane produces circular cross section particles collided whereas vertical direction changes motion based temperature overall parameters including bin sizes may modified also important note bin size selected large visible artifacts generated animation also present mpeg artifacts present animation flame quite yet sure first frame animation provided top view provided possible see top view criss cross pattern obvious artifact using bins combination motion mechanism although unsure case also flame tends pulse one frame next something would preferably occur unsure causing oscillatory motion another benefit using bins interdependent particle systems parallelization opposed passing particles associated information across bin boundaries information contained bins need passed save given amount information
