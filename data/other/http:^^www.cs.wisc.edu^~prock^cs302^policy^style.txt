language matter source code looks like matters humans also reading source code class program needs easily understood instructor grader environments program need understood members programming team members testing team programmers maintaining code leave project thus good programming style important ingredient good software engineering readable code efficient software production process think source code document describing implementation like writing paper article blueprint freedom make choices regarding present document however also know stay within guidelines popular convention type document creating people reading document easier time understanding tension creative freedom conventions dictating style responsibility find appropriate balance style style format layout program commented source code context cs concentrate following aspects indentation placement curly brackets whitespace comments identifier names indentation fixed width indentation almost indentation occurs fixed width intervals usually using interval single tab two spaces following example program indented four spaces per indentation program bean counter int main int number beans number beans user const double bean weight average bean weight grams cout number beans number beans cout care much indent must consistant indenting indent two spaces level level must indent two spaces level level furthermore indent two spaces anywhere code must indent two spaces everywhere code level following items begin level preprocessor directives e g include iostream h function headers class headers global variables global declarations level statements indented indent function control statement statement nested within always indent whether control statement uses curly brackets necessary indent case labels within switch statements public private labels within class definitions may wish see beans bacon beans bacon else beans bacon beans else bacon beans bacon beans beans beans bacon switch switch number beans case cout switch switch number beans case cout placement curly brackets several common styles used lining curly brackets important thing consistant use one style anywhere code must use style everywhere code option header body body option header body body option header body body whitespace vertical whitespace program two blank lines functions furthur single blank line break statements within function logical units function eat beans description notice two blank lines function next function void eat beans void cout horizontal whitespace single space operators operands example like int cout operators like unary generally take horizontal whitespace like beans j like beans j comments program header program block comments top file contains main function comments must contain name program name course section date email address addition must include brief summary program describes program kinds inputs necessary bugs deficiencies program bean counter name gregory c sharp class cs

comments embedded code comments embedded code following reasons introduce logically distinct section code explain unusual coding technique following example function contains embedded comments function count beans description first take sample beans database aproximate weight use estimate total number carton return number beans int count beans carton carton sample beans database get average weight int double average average weight within sample identifier names naming conventions identifiers including variables functions classes descriptive name name need long must relate semantic meaning identifier like double starting location time velocity double location starting location time velocity like double v double l v hand use short letter identifiers temporary variables loop variables input variables like int finally please use capital letters constants like const int max beans like const int max beans last modified sat sep cdt greg sharp greg cs wisc edu http www cs wisc
