developing cost effective computer architectures take advantage rapidly changing technologies research program two major thrusts evaluating performance feasibility correctness new architectures developing new tools techniques facilitate evaluation currently research focusses following three areas multi paradigm multiprocessors efficiently integrate shared memory message passing hybrid programming paradigms virtual prototyping system exploits similarites existing parallel machine simulate hypothetical parallel machine techniques understanding tuning program performance recent results include developing new interface called tempest user level protocol handlers system supplied mechanisms tempest provides mechanisms allow programmers compilers program libraries implement use message passing transparent shared memory hybrid combinations two tempest mechanisms low overhead messages bulk data transfer virtual memory management fine grain access control novel mechanism fine grain access control allows user software tag blocks e g bytes read write read invalid local memory used transparently cache remote data exploring alternative ways support interface first called typhoon proposed hardware platform implements tempest mechanisms fully programmable user level processor network interface reverse translation table rtlb invokes network processor detects fine grain access fault simulated typhoon wisconsin wind tunnel found transparent shared memory protocol running typhoon performs comparably hardware dir n nb cache coherence protocol five shared memory programs also developed new memory system simulation method optimizes common case cache hits significantly reducing simulation time fast cache tightly integrates reference generation simulation providing abstraction tagged memory blocks reference invokes user specified function depending upon reference type memory block state simulator controls references processed manipulating memory block states specifying special null function action cases fast cache implements abstraction using binary rewriting perform table lookup memory reference sparcstation fast cache simulation times two three times faster conventional trace driven simulator calls procedure memory reference simulation times three six times slower original un instrumented program also investigating using fast cache binary rewriting techniques support tempest interface existing hardware platforms last updated july
