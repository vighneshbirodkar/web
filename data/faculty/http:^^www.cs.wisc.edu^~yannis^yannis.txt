scientific databases user interfaces information visualization complex query optimization heterogeneous databases research primarily focuses two areas database systems optimization complex queries database support scientific data future database applications pose several new challenges query optimization complexity queries asked significantly higher traditional systems number alternative evaluation algorithms much higher well especially use parallelism attempts optimize several values run time parameters parametric query optimization thus number alternative access plan processing query extremely large currently used algorithms finding optimum among inadequate research investigates use randomized optimization algorithms viable solution problem primarily interested simulated annealing genetic algorithms well alternatives take advantage special properties query optimization also looking complex query scheduling problems especially arise parallel multimedia environments error propagation size cost estimates complex queries also part studies trying identify appropriate information must maintained database system limit propagation error end m primarily focusing identifying properties optimal histograms approximate distribution values relation attributes computational mode investigation expected part many experiments various scientific disciplines future databases generated need specialized support many aspects current technology ready provide involved development zoo desktop experiment management environment help scientists throughout life cycle experimental studies primary component system database system two major issues work addresses visual user interfaces semantic heterogeneity former m concentrating identifying right metaphors representing complex database schemas queries objects scientists natural also investigating power dynamic visual queries latter m concentrating developing visual tools facilitate translation integration different data formats schemas although issues generic arise experimental scientific disciplines efforts guided needs specific projects associated particular simulation based performance
