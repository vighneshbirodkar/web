wolberg w n street o l mangasarian past six years colleagues university wisconsin madison taken mathematical technique originally developed oil prospecting modified create computerized method diagnosing cancer breast tissue samples obtained technique called fine needle aspiration fna past interpreting fna samples rather subjective program able develop accurate objective system fna interpretation computer program also able first time calculate mathematical probability sample malignant rather use fuzzy terms atypical suspicious sharing probability data patients involve decision making process greater degree previously possible particular instead make recommendation based solely upon values provide patients probability data let make minds subsequent treatment expect computer program putting pathologists business time soon expect prove useful objective backup pathologists assist improving fna interpretative skills role fna breast cancer diagnosis majority beast cancer cases discovery mass feeling lump breast represents first sign cancer present however finding breast mass necessarily signal cancer present indeed breast masses benign malignant currently definitive way distinguish benign malignant breast masses pathologist examine sample breast tissue microscope obtain tissue surgeons traditionally performed breast biopsy take patient operating room administer anesthesia cut open breast remove piece tissue recently fna emerged less invasive less painful less expensive alternative surgical breast biopsy name suggests breast fna involves inserting small needle breast suctioning cells syringe procedure takes minutes require anesthesia problem fna subjectivity recently however interpretation fna specimen highly subjective process absence firm objective diagnostic criteria relies heavily training experience persons examining tissue although fna gained wide acceptance diagnosis cancer thyroid certain organs clinicians treating breast cancer usually preferred employ less subjective diagnostic procedures breast biopsy looking microscope pieces breast biopsy tissue pathologists examine intact structure breast tissue look certain signs provide definitive signs malignancy one sign instance call invasiveness pathologist sees group cells invading normal tissue invasion sufficient indicator cancer present fna technique though destroys structure breast tissues thus forces pathologists base interpretation almost entirely appearance individual cells sample pathologists examining breast fna specimen need evaluate number cell features size shape various nuclear characteristics however since single one features able yield unequivocal diagnosis malignancy pathologists subjectively weigh various features order arrive diagnosis instances various cell features point direction diagnosis malignant vs benign clear cut instances though features point different directions suggesting malignant others suggesting benign different observers might arrive different verdicts depending choose weigh conflicting pieces evidence face potential uncertainty consequences wrong diagnosis clinicians reluctant rely fna diagnosing breast cancer prospecting cancer chance encounter olvi l mangasarian ph d professor computer sciences department uw madison described frustrations encountered trying find objective way interpreting fna specimens realized problem analogous linear programming problem studied years earlier working oil industry problem drill oil like evaluating fna samples cancer deciding drill oil involves finding way weigh number factors geological features single one definitively predict whether one find oil solve oil prospecting problem dr mangasarian developed method call multisurface pattern separation adapted use fna samples essence method begins us mathematically modelling cytological features size shape need evaluate order determine whether fna sample malignant next train computer data two sets fna samples already know diagnosis one set benign samples second set malignant samples machine process iteratively build portions fence two data sets completely fenced two data sets trained computer enter data unknown fna sample computer determines side fence sample falls makes appropriate diagnosis malignant benign computer also calculates probability malignancy serves quantitative measure degree computer certain diagnosis image analysis using digital image analysis techniques developed mr nick street computer science graduate student largely automated computerized system interpreting fna samples look microscope find suitable views sample use video camera attached microscope record images computer digitizes video pictures stores data computer files run fna analysis computer program reconstructs digitized microscopic image displays computer screen computer operator simply uses mouse trace rough outlines nuclei computer rest desired operator trace nuclei remove nuclei already traced return analysis findings results first goal make diagnosis breast cancer fna samples objective accurate previously possible succeeded developing highly accurate diagnostic system requires modest level expertise operate training set fna samples calculate system correctly diagnose breast fna samples time practice system correctly diagnosed last samples tested second goal develop objective method determining prognosis patients diagnostic program identifies breast cancer accurately predict likelihood cancer recur regards goal still relatively early stage development samples training set although encouraged results date still need add samples training set improve program accuracy one key findings studies discovery computer program nuclear features e nuclear grade accurate determining prognosis determinations prognosis based traditional measures tumor size axillary node status research may thus significant impact current practice surgeon performing axillary lymph node dissection time mastectomy prognostic purposes presently determination whether breast cancer spread patient axillary lymph nodes considered important factor establishing prognosis patients tumor spread axillary lymph nodes e g node positive higher likelihood tumor recurrence without tumor spread axillary lymph nodes e g node negative patients node positive tumors tend also earlier recurrences general worse patients node negative tumors data research however indicated patient nodal status node positive vs node negative provides new additional information prognosis beyond already available fna biopsy use fna data alone run prognostic program results accurate run program using fna data plus information nodal status tumor size found analysis patient fna sample alone provides information prognosis need thus performing axillary lymph node dissection solely prognostic purposes unnecessary studies institutions confirm findings many breast cancer patients future could spared necessity undergoing axillary lymph node biopsy future directions seeking collaborate institutions validate computer program using fna samples patented program willing provide copies program researchers sign collaborative agreements us recently analyzed breast fna slides ucla gratified find correctly diagnosed also interested expanding computerized interpretative method organs besides breasts good early results thyroid cancer also believe approach could prove particularly useful evaluating lymphomas last modified thu jan nick street street cs wisc edu
