buffering dumps writing tape holding disk allows amanda run backups parallel disk writing tape backup finished note holding disk required without amanda run backups sequentially tape drive running way kills great performance still allows take advantage amanda features rule thumb best performance holding disk larger dump output largest disk partitions example backing full gigabyte disks compress mb ll want mb holding disk hand gigabyte drives partitioned mb filesystems ll probably compress mb ll need much holding disk amanda perform better larger holding disks use mb holding disk actually amanda still work full dumps larger holding disk amanda send dumps directly tape one time many dumps limited dump speed machines systems amanda run amanda run modern unix system supports dump sockets inetd
