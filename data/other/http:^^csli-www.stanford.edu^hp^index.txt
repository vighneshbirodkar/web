software program unlike traditional treatments first order logic hyperproof combines graphical sentential information presenting set logical rules integrating different forms information strategy allows students focus information content proofs rather syntactic structure sentences also reflects heterogeneity information encountered everyday reasoning using hyperproof student learns construct
