selected potential funding candidate arpa collaboration technology design research institute recognizes way engineers work together team important individual contributions thus collaboration technology forms third component dri research agenda dri activities area providing shared access objects corporate memory enabling effective communication among engineers toward latter cooperative engineering environment development featuring structured dialog among members team facilitate resolution engineering changes product design research area beginning expected grow involve analysis engineering processes development additional tools facilitate collaboration special interest enabling effective teamwork among engineers separated several time zones corporate participation companies joining institute typically participate locating research staff campus case xerox founding partner group seven scientists within corporate research group permanently established cornell xerox provides cornell yearly grant offsets cost offices support services corporate partners benefit participation dri several ways companies leverage intellectual investment financial investment participation collaborative research university faculty students well scientists partner companies government external funding expected support cornell affiliates site collaboration partner companies direct involvement establishing research agenda institute problems drawn industrial context distilled fundamental research questions approach provides new scale perspective unusual academic research promises exceptional synergy partner companies also convenient first access research developments dri including research involving scientists companies many avenues technology transfer including joint projects campus company units hosting visiting scientists campus intellectual property rights research design research institute intended open non proprietary results available use partner companies developed published scientific journals appropriate cover ownership rights inventions deriving current dri research intellectual property rights agreement reached principle cornell xerox provides rights inventions xerox employee shall covered standard xerox policy rights inventions cornell employee shall covered standard cornell policy case joint invention xerox cornell employees rights shall jointly owned joint ownership generally implies party right use license invention independently either party wishes case dri joint ownership redefined parties mutual benefit parties additional corporate partners join dri issue intellectual property rights revisited expected agreements developed cover new partners similar xerox cornell model steering committee institute organization policy institute established steering committee whose membership includes representatives cornell partner companies present committee consists three cornell members five xerox members additional corporate partners join dri institute office created augment offices individual companies director expected named time cornell xerox sharing administration dri institute grows envisioned include separate branches focusing key areas dri research branches engage various units cornell partner companies government agencies may participate branches choose design research institute engineering theory center cornell
