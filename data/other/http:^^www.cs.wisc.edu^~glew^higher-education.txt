assures need ph d establish position industry probably right sometimes dream less stressful job hours week world class work rather work hours week intel spending time cruft m probably fooling d like take time think new ideas intel eaten whole slew ideas stored came m working intel gives little opportunity type deep though least need come good ideas much afraid go back school reproduce job path many people see around intel fellows idea consumers instead idea generators course hope intel new microcomputer research labs member provide sort opportunity deep thought think need want work one two chips p would like opportunity retire university would like day go home canada meant work u years aren many jobs computer designers canada ph d gives option left ph d wife wife left ll return ph d ph d won ever assming eventually family like thinking deeply people used accuse ivory tower fact probably still least years industry probably proven one teach decide become professor would like something lasting world design cpus think fundamental things learned cpu design apply areas like psychology government etc want role designing artificial intelligences eventually replace mankind moment needs faster computers sob story sometimes feel missed lot university career undergrad mcgill discovering computers learning skip classes losing scholarship worked way succession computer jobs working hours week first job phase years little software house prairie must person move urbana without knowing university illinois masters illinois leave urbana wen mei hwu arrived since shared interest order processor design stayed worked classes part time rate one semester heavy load enough distract work gould motorola years wife finally finished undergraduate degree deal could apply jobs anyplace u wanted long good computer architecture school ph d didn really look hard chose chicago time good schools computer architecture moved chicago went part time work ta ed vlsi design class bell labs indian hill facility uiuc would pay trips chicago visit didn work eventually chose quickest topic could finish ms get snoopy cache test test set without excessive bus contention proving interest knowledge mp memory ordering even though actual research notebooks order cpu design specifically harrm hardware register renaming mechanism addressed wen mei told worst timing path hpsm removing associative logic register file explicit renaming stage overall machine working looked lot like p end looking mechanisms convergent code gus uht reminds minimal control dependencies mechanism avoid throwing away work branch misprediction turns independent path branch hoping combine extremely long trace cache lines get high ilp although ve always feeling ilp overrated order non superscalar situation advantages hidden aspect research didn understand later explained chose work wen mei hpsm became apparent wen mei moving towards compilers vliw away dynamic scheduling wen mei first number hardware students dropped last hardware student part time paying way intel p finally got m quick dirty mp cache coherence topic came intel p basically consumed whole slew ideas stored intel give space think new things new ideas wanted throughout p project biggest memory job interview gould steve bunch saying re smart guy need smart people lots new ideas np sexy new cpu best new idea came since joining intel use redundant arithmetic index cache thinking using redundant arithmetic general purpose cpu last two years illinois ever since took classes robertson solved memory indexing problem read paper b k without carry propagation two spaniards didn realize done shortly came intel consider first wholly intel idea talked much university basically never got full time student fault obstreperousness except last spurt research ms never got enjoy university really enjoyed first taste academic research frankly feel bit cheated ve also got great big chip shoulder never well undergrad never published stuff worked hard ms never published classy setting real proof m smart guy sure worked p think contributed lot probably think contributed hell lot good people working p proof bob glenn dave mike andy p architect ever get called front room receive plaque yes m paranoid insecure least m honest maybe felt secure would become complacent never come original idea guess ph d way showing smart ideas incontrovertibly mine ph d b d fear however quite bit scared returning school like multiple classes like one thing intensely crash courses time management skills need work good deferring interest topic seized idea exhaust working upto hours straight often able make class next morning even test hell often even know day hope ten years experience industry tamed tendency bit y know know want tamed m actually quite afraid get trouble class requirements ph d world class research m afraid although somewhat afraid may told various members committee think work hell bottom line m glutton punishment moreover m punish image anyone recommendations good image editor doesn html support vector non pixel art advice say finish undergrad quickly possible yes know frustrating go boring classes much want investigate new ideas tough possible get interesting stuff quickly possible like square peg round hole persevere choose goals work towards let failing classes losing scholarship ideas laughed get smart people drift around according interesting ideas betters mentors give makes life easy working betters mentors think rebels choose topics lucky choose right ones d like hire smart non conformists like hard find mass resumes sort grade point averages classes degrees fit make stand flaunt successes maybe even failures got first good job resume contained graph pointing bimodal distribution grades create portfolio work done outside formal settings engage shameless self promotion even isn something feel comfortable drones anyway old biy networks references honour societies beat game beat counts producing successful products use web internet wonderfully democratic place drones may say isn anything good comp arch favorite newsgroup may someone like reading making note people make sense irrespective whether come fancy gradschool podunk chop shop shop around problems undergrad thought universities taught way necessarily true different styles learning people like multiple classes like like crash courses people like homework others like exams american schools emphasize classes british schools emphasize lecture series examinations law schools use case method others use conventional classes shop around style education best one tragedies modern life number people turned first style education encountered would done well another single right style useless cry mismatch solve shouldn say drones pejorative mean drones people everything seems easy well everything choose rather drift according whatever placed front opposed troublemakers like tell resent beware drones necessarily less smart less creative rebels fact may well smarter maybe aren drifting really intellectual goals want acheive go things easy way certainly luckier us rebels aren less creative aren less smart contribute much society rebels easy rebel fall trap thinking rebellion valuable isn least necessarily want say re rebellious nature doesn nothing work nature take advantage beat drones
