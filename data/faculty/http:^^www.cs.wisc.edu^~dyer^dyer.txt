basic tools controlling real time either autonomously interactively virtual camera real environment input set images video streams acquired fixed mobile cameras around site output panoramic visualization scene virtual user controlled camera moved environment technology user could interactively navigate real environment controlling customized path views site predetermined input images main research question adaptively combine set basis images synthesize new views scene without d models d scene reconstruction intermediate step recently developed innovative technique call view morphing takes two basis images interpolates continuous range images corresponding views linear path connecting two camera centers visual exploration computer vision researchers recently started investigate actively control image acquisition process controlling camera parameters studying purposefully control position orientation camera order dynamically adjust viewpoint based appearance three dimensional scene use real time viewpoint control behaviors important solving tasks exploring unknown object order find specific surface markings building global model unknown shape recognizing object coordinating simple observer behaviors change appearance surfaces well defined way simplify image computations required make precise global progress algorithm eliminate need accurate differential
