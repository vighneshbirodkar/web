table contents introduction data transformation visualization procedures results conclusion figures mpeg acknowledge references introduction geographic information system gis powerful tool used many fields especially environmental monitoring analysis however gis software packages focus analysis often limited presentation ability combination gis scientific visualization enables researchers field gis present processes results work audience manner realistic sense project visualized processes results gis analysis simulating distribution nitric pollutants watershed accordance geographic topological environmental conditions analysis done team coordinated prof stephen degloria center environment cornell using various gis software packages independently developed programs goal project generat flexible prototype visualization modules typical gis work using ibm data explorer data transformation like visualization work first task project acquire necessary data data used analysis include digital elevation models dem hydrology models runoff water content soil data landuse types etc hydrology data collected two year series results analysis consist distribution three nitrogen compounds study time series nitric pollutant simulated four different layers region study area since data came different sources simulation done analysis team using different packages self developed programs data formats diverse addition considering huge data volume limitation data storage machines data stored cornell theory center unitree mass storage set retrived via afs whenever needed data fetched converted consistent format using several unix shell scripts c programs one purposes data conversion speed data extraction two year master hydrology nitrogen data otherwise time consuming deal different formats different data sets visualization procedures shell scripts programs used data conversion extended generate dx input file various data set example dem dx importing dem dx scripts programs flexible form dx retrive various data different time period without changing anything except right parameters call programs scripts properly importing data dx needs conduct coordinate transformation dx right hand coordinate system gis data left hand coordinat systems even particular coordinate systems addition since data came different sources may collected different time different cell resolutions two data sets involved one application data interpolated manually adjusted correct coordinate displacements assume data correctly correspondent positions next step construct prototype two dimensional three dimensional display several color look tables generated format dx compatible lut soil landuse displays hydrology nitrogen data colored colormap module dx however distributions nitrigen hydrology data linear special log scale scheme adopted log transform data interactively log algorithm described adopting algorithm values data scaled values newmin specified unfortunately results log algorithm varies user sepecified newmin newmax therefore different data sets need different parameters accomplish reasonable redistribution data values last part visualization procedures provide adjustible animation options different scenarios project two dimensional three dimensional animations provided order provide ultimate flexibility parameters built control panels users specify values interactively parameters include file data selectors data layer selectors coordinate correction parameters log algorithm parameters display options viewing control etc results addition shell scripts programs c code mentioned several dx nets accomplished project provide visualization animation functions different demands dx nets also equiped control panel type user interfaces inputing interactively adjusting data displays well generating images animations according different scenarios final results actually dependent scenarios desired visualization outputs dx also redirected packages instruments post processing example generating broadcast quality video tape include several images animations generated dx nets conclusion scientific visualization techniques strengthen presentation power gis providing thorough viewing options multi dimensional space extends gis another world moreover interactive adjusting psudo real time display changes examining data also improve accuracy gis analysis dx nets generated project provide analysis team alternative review work different perspectives present processes results effective understandable way since dx nets built provide prototype visualizing gis work used generate various displays animations accordance different purposes also easily modified similar gis analysis projects adopt tentative future work project might
