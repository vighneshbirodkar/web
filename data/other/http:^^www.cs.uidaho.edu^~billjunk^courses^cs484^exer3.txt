jerry gibons performing electrical mechanical design product new products development considers leadership responsibilities new generation suresafe products three months ago project started management felt time frame months realistic previous track record computer controlled security systems extensive leveraging existing systems also voice recognition software purchased softcraft already developed thus eliminating major portion design work however due several significant specification changes resulting rework project projected two months behind schedule software hardware design underway prototype hardware unit due completed engineers within next two weeks software ready try prototype three weeks attempt keep project moving fast possible management instituted bonus plan whereby project team monetarily rewarded meeting future project deadlines time following documentation available marketing analysis preliminary functional specification preliminary electronics schematics mechanical assembly drawings software architecture diagram module hierarchy major data structures source code listings softcraft programs marketing believes market window narrow pushing expedient development path possible important trade show weeks away important specialty medical working system show potential new clients assessment qa manager martin adams openly expressed concerns organization adequately prepared meeting demands development project believes company may pushing hard meet upcoming trade show deadline cutting corners design work particularly concerned faulty system would serious harm company reputation heard extensive experience software field retained consultant wants study situation prepare software quality assurance plan effective helping ensure high
