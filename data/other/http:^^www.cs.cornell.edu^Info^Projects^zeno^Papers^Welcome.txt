acharya abstract current compression formats optimize either compression editing example motion jpeg mjpeg provides excellent random moderate overall compression mpeg optimizes compression expense random access converting one format another process called transcoding often desirable life video segment paper show transcode mpeg video motion jpeg without fully decompressing mpeg source compressed domain transcoding technique differs previous work uses new technique optimized software implementation compare performance working implementation compressed domain transcoder instead counting number multiplies needed transcode experiments show compressed domain transcoder times faster optimized spatial domain transcoder offers another benefit single parameter improve speed transcoding expense quality resulting images speed quality trade important many real time applications acrobat k gzipped postscript k cu seeme vr immersive desktop teleconferencing appear acm multimedia jefferson han brian c smith abstract current video conferencing systems provide video window user interface paper presents video conferencing application called cu seeme vr provides richer interface cu seeme vr distributed video conferencing system allows users connect d worlds interact using live video audio embedded virtual space paper describes prototype implementation cu seeme vr including user interface system architecture detailed look enabling technologies future directions metaphors space discussed html version acrobat version k compressed domain processing jpeg encoded images appear real time imaging journal brian c smith lawrence rowe july abstract paper addresses problem processing motion jpeg video data compressed domain operations covered pixel output image arbitrary linear combination pixels input image includes convolution scaling rotation translation morphing de interlacing image composition transcoding paper develops approximation technique called condensation improve performance evaluates condensations terms processing speed image quality using condensation motion jpeg video processed near real time rates current generation workstations acrobat version k massively distributed video file server simulation investigating intelligent caching schemes alexander castro c edward lazzerini vivekananda kolla december abstract paper final report cs graduate multimedia

techniques reconnecting science humanities digital libraries university kentuky brian c smith oct abstract short paper surveys current techniques compressing compressed multimedia data including compressed audio video images html version acrobat version k resolution independent video language presented acm multimedia jonathan swartz brian c smith november abstract common video processing programmers still implement video programs manipulations arrays pixels paper presents language extension called rivl pronounced rival video first class data type programs rivl use high level operators independent video resolution format increasing program portability simplifying code reuse reducing development time paper also describes rivl interpreter strategies interpreter uses optimize rivl programs optimizations include classical programming language optimizations common subexpression elimination order execution image video specific optimizations computing images affect output optimized
