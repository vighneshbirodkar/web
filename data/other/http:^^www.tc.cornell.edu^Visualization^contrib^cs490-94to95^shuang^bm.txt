modeler including summary previous research leading actual project instructions installation operation software likewise provided introduction blobby modeler theoretical foundation came goals hope achieve development software design methodologies implementation stages installing using blobby modeler conclusion summary features accomplished perhaps future directions references relevant publications introduction established geometric modeling techniques exist handle engineering components including free form shapes car bodies telephones recently lot interest modeling natural

wyvill craig mcpheeters brian wyvill early james blinn began exploring methods model molecular structures often done ball stick space filling sphere models interest artistic variety scientific accuracy new model appear like real electron density cloud covalent bond conventional approaches model shape via familiar bicubic quadric surfaces difficult elaborate molecules reason seek simulate actual electron map quantum mechanic representation atoms density function spatial location example hydrogen atom might represented d x y z exp ar r distance location center atom several atoms present scene effects density field simply added extracting surface constant value across field molecular density cloud formed blinn named blobby model years later wyvill mcpheeters wyvill decided apply technique generally modeling soft objects traditionally awkward best render presented modification blinn exponential function one computationally cheaper additionally function desirable quality able

immediately obvious research achieve reasonable degree realism modeling anything simple molecules blobby model composed large number typically hundreds atoms ibm dataexplorer dx provides primitive modules used create blobby models however since creation model involves placement many atoms manual design ceases good option quickly blobby modeler designed ease task creation models well compute resulting density field line prevent overloading dx blobby modeler written c tcl tk spring semester partial fulfillment requirements toward cs master engineering project supervision dr bruce land cornell university department computer science goals following design goals blobby modeler ease use software adhere familiar user interface conventions minimize learning curve increase productivity quickly simplicity software easy use maintain run alongside dx fit modest amount memory speed software fast enough increase productivity rather decrease portability software portable across unix platforms usable cornell theory center ibm aix computer science department undergraduate laboratory hp ux sunos attempt porting linux test system v based machines designing blobby modeler three dimensional modeler running conventional computer difficulty unsuitable input devices attempts made allow mouse control two dimensions keyboard third personally think clumsy awkward use instead adapted approach taken many personal computer graphics tools well graphics workstation software provided three editing windows degrees freedom encompassed blobby modeler hosts editable windows fixed xy yz xz views addition provides free window camera placed space model previewed rendering free window simplistic fact crude however complicated preview window slow response software considerably defeats goal lean mean virtue proximity blobby modeler written sunos platform specifically one running sunos target platform would ideally platform dx would support though able test many operating systems versions m fairly confident code port quite easily facilitate development user interface selected tcl tk toolkit versions respectively since interpreted language offers complicated link c also selected add called embedded tk et version d richard hipp drh world std com tcl tk available various sites including ftp cs berkeley edu ftp x org among others et available ftp std com roughly speaking divided tasks among tcl tk c writing tcl tk code isn cpu intensive c portion turned include functions generate field including horrible quadruple nested loop manage free window implement d transforms d projections c portion notable feature liberal use global variables store partial results done improve performance reducing redundant recomputations values involving trigonometric functions cached variables recomputed necessary c fragments simple straightforward composing one fourth total number lines code tcl tk portion software handles user machine interactions handling drawing selecting windows refreshes others three fourths program involved since first tcl tk program performance likely improved rewriting routines help text worth mentioning though implemented small widget tcl display small subset html subtle differences implementation html unlike html carriage returns significant help text nested formats work formats cannot span different lines despite conversion two formats difficult conclusions future directions present state blobby modeler complete d editing platform ready beta testing undoubtedly undergoes actual usage problems arise enhancements made glaringly absent however ability move atoms animation capability blobby modeler probably used model scenes boiling water animation definitely desirable addition aside spherical atoms also interesting incorporate atoms shapes aid construction scene cubes certainly easy work instance free window course vastly improved include renderer prevent small trouble go dx order render scene
