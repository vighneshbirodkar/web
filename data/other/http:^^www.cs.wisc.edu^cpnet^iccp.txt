hopkins university baltimore november meeting attended researchers around world including attendees australia belgium canada czech republic denmark finland germany great britain india italy japan netherlands norway portugal sweden united states meeting organized aim bringing together researchers mathematical programming aspects complementarity problems experts variety applications areas purpose meeting create increased cross fertilization communication areas particular better understanding appreciation different aspects areas considers expected beneficial effective solution practical complementarity problems arising applied disciplines believe meeting great success three decades research subject complementarity problems become well established fruitful discipline within mathematical programming sources complementarity problems diverse include many problems engineering economics sciences several monographs surveys documented basic theory algorithms applications complementarity problems role optimization theory meeting started overview complementarity field stage new web site cpnet http www cs wisc edu cpnet announced completed site eventually contain date information upcoming conferences area list active researchers pointers work algorithms applications software currently page contains list researchers present conference along papers software outline developments area includes growing collection test problems mcp mcplib complementarity toolbox suite programs routines use conjunction matlab hoped cpnet allow collection grow considerably include many new algorithms application problems pointers extensions modeling software allow real applications formulated standard modeling languages various themes developed meeting several speakers introduced new extensions basic framework cited applications needed extensions new theoretical results outlined relating vertical horizontal extended linear complementarity problems along several ideas unify areas speakers considered noncooperative stochastic game theory outlined existence results algorithms solution variational bimatrix inequalities also drew attention several talks merit functions smoothing techniques also popular topics one extension received considerable attention mathematical program equilibrium constraints mpec several algorithms given solution problems lots discussion resulted application talks relating reformulating problems framework appears fruitful area future research contact problems rich source complementarity problems problems complementarity result contact condition stipulates gap two objects contact either zero pressure zero classical obstacle problems extended include effects convection diffusion interesting use complementarity contact mechanics arises robot design key features problem modeled new framework include sliding friction rigid body properties structural mechanics also used complementarity models studies material elasticity plasticity several informative interesting talks opened areas field general complementarity used economics long time renowned walrasian law supply demand general equilibrium theory states either excess supply price corresponding good zero several extensions basic idea outlined talks dealt oligopolistic equilibria integrated assessment problems energy modeling relocation effects due european common market national energy modeling system nems use similar models traffic assignment also outlined area dynamic models becoming important several new ideas tolling congestion analysis presented meeting several new algorithmic developments outlined meeting involved traditional simplicial pivotal based techniques others used novel reformulations complementarity problem smooth nonsmooth systems nonlinear equations popular approach takes systems nonsmooth equations applies smoothing traditional newton based techniques could applied still methods based quadratic programming proximal points formulations new computational extensions also outlined several talks introduced new merit functions prove useful error analysis future algorithmic design conclusion meeting showed field complementarity research burgeoning area already many interesting algorithms solving complementarity problems along fairly sophisticated techniques analysis computation growth number new application areas use framework require even sophisticated solution techniques furthermore clear even applications developed use complementarity modeling form another significant portion made possible meeting refereed proceedings meeting published siam developments area undoubtedly reported next international conference complementarity problems planning already way conference tentatively set july
