first kind even brought together one hundred researchers major university industrial research labs share strong interest creation large scale personalized information delivery systems workshop covered aspects emerging area including relation established field information retrieval ir variety methods filtering architectural concerns high speed filtering systems variety existing prototype applications well requirements future applications special issue features five articles represent scope content workshop article represents different aspect field together form realistic view workshop addition present four sidebars depicting individual snapshots emerging filtering approach applications belkin croft ask answer question information filtering information retrieval two sides coin authors determine information filtering well defined process examining foundations comparing foundations ir enterprise authors find little difference filtering retrieval abstract level conclude two
