structured techniques change program instruction space program running variety common overlapping names dynamic compilation self modifying code also variety less polite names friends let friends use smc email signature term demand driven compilation narrower rtcg typically means parts language translation process performed unit code unit invoked demand driven compilation may contrasted runtime code generation performed speculatively demand driven dynamic linking address space modified without compilation self modifying code code unit updated necessarily unit invoked term dynamic compilation also narrower typically encompassing code generated dynamically self modify dynamic compilation often applied systems using general purpose core code generators performing code generation sophisticated inputs e g expressions rather simple values dynamically loaded source code pseudocode beware term dynamic compilation nowadays often used also mean compilation literary works done ongoing incremental basis e g dynamic linking adds code instruction space program code typically generated using code generator outside program new code may generated demand application dynamically linked code also used implement language independent enhancement extension elilminate machine dependencies binaries reduce size binaries unfortunately term also sometimes used describe building hypermedia connections ongoing incremental basis term runtime compilation often used describe loop parallelization done runtime performs code generation idea runtime compilation loop carried data dependencies e g x y z discovered static compiler e g x y z cannot system thus examines values runtime performs parallelization runtime based values system thus compiles information runtime performs code generation write shun tak leung shuntak cs washington edu information instruction space modification general term including topic changes bits instruction space whether change comes inside application outside time comiplation jit general idea steps compilation may deferred code invoked moment systems use jit name systems use dynamic compilation get good performance portable machine os independent program representation typically unit translation loadable unit smaller example modules procedures statements etc input virtual machine byte code rather source text trees etc jit used refer code generation dynamic link time well invocation time contrast many systems perform compilation time goal fine tuning machine dependent code etc preceise longer name classical jit probably something like demand driven specialization processor architecture module procedure level term self modifying code smc also refers rtcg harder pin many interpretations modify many ways pronounce self modification may mean instruction executed manipulated place executed may mean region memory reused holds several instructions lifetime may mean instruction space changes even part reused problem self
