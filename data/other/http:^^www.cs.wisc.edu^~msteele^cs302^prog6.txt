service doctors decided expand business addition usual service finding doctors find people dentists hair dressers well even make appointments need able save information though everyone sick tired writing stuff paper killing trees obviously information needs stored computer believe come need write program fill three appointments users request doctor dentist hair appointment first ask user want make particular appointment ask relevent time information month day hour minute appointments made print user appointments time either military standard format ask want typical run program would look something like want make doctor appointment y enter month enter day month enter hour enter minute want make dental appointment n want make hair appointment y enter month enter day month enter hour enter minute doctor appointment military m standard time appointment monday january pm hair appointment military m standard time m appointment wednesday march lots variables needed store information appointment follows month month year jan feb mar dec must enumerated type day month day month make life easier months year days integer legal values day week day week mon tue sun must enumerated type hour day hour day appointments stored military time integer th hour midnight minute hour minute hour integer filled whether data appointment set must enumerated boolean type six variables since storing three different appointments would mean variable declarations also would nice could set functions appointments able protect appointment data parts program sane solution potential problems define implement appointment class get away three declarations appointment objects nicely modularized program stated define appointment class must contain six variables storing appointment information also contain following functions appointment public constructor initialize filled false indicate appointment set yet set day private function set day week variable based upon current month day month assume january monday months exactly days since dealing classes need formal parameters need return anything read app public function fill necessary appointment information first prompt read month day month hour minute make sure legitimate values hour read military format month read int type cast month enumerated type set day week calling set day thus read app prompt user day week set filled indicate appointment set filled public return true current object appointment set false otherwise function necessary filled variable private accessed caller print mil time private function print time military hour format require parameters need return anything print stan time private function print time standard hour format require parameters need return anything remember midnight noon pm write app public function write appointment information ask user wants time printed military standard format appropriate error checking probably want function print day week month day month entire name month written number print time format user requests calling one two private time print functions main able harm class data variables int class must made private constructor function appointment must made public hard fast rule constructors also functions read app write app filled called main made public functions needed outside class remaining functions must therefore remain private main part relatively simple first thing need declare three objects type appointment appointment prompt user wants fill particular appointment e g doctor call read app fill necessary information done three appointments print appointment set checked calling filled manner similar example suggestions final notes notice main within one class functions need read character yes type question error checking something done within function writing class often looks messy preconditions postconditions class definition instead following class definition next prototypes member function write short description line function function definitions member function write detailed explanation function works might good idea write formal preconditions postconditions less formal description still thoroughly describes parameters function returns function ll accept well far organizing program suggestion enumerated types class definition function prototypes near top program follwed divider follwed main section code followed auxiliary functions class member functions followed another divider followed class member function definitions divider mean comment something like member functions appointment class appointment class member functions way come visually separate one section program another extra vertical space addition place dividing line excellent idea turn usual want electronic submission printed copy source code cpp file also turn printed copy least one sample run program demonstrates program works click return cs section projects page last modified wed nov mike steele msteele cs wisc
