date mon nov gmt server ncsa content type text html last modified fri nov gmt content length classes classes class extension struct introduce classes slowly extending functionality structs studied last week one apparent differences class struct addition data members like struct class member functions methods think member functions operations objects belong class example imagine wanted augment alien struct declared last week every alien capable giving greeting would declare class const int maxstr class alien public char name maxstr char homeplanet maxstr int numlegs int isdeadly void greet char notice added additional member called greet class alien unlike members member declared variable array member prototype function takes array characters produces return value also added word public talk later prototype half function need give function definition could look like void alien greet char cout hello name name homeplanet nlet friends ever n looks lot like normal function definition return type void parameter list char code making function body different function name alien greet class declaration prototype name greet going well possible one class might method member function called greet example might robot class might greet method order specify greet method providing body need give class name function called alien greet read name meaning greet method alien class thing called scope resolution operator used specify second operand case greet one specified scope first operand case alien used whenever want grab part class see additional uses operator later might saying hold one second using variables name homeplanet greet method without declared method body ok see means soon defined greet method alien class need call suppose couple aliens appears somewhere maybe main alien yoda alien darth yet talked initializing objects time assume yoda name yoda home planet dagobah darth name lord vader home planet death star call greet functions code appears somewhere maybe main yoda greet dad darth greet mom call method particular object variable using dot operator done file streams remember cin getline fin getline also seen way accessing data members structs basically dot operator used whenever want grab piece object contrast scope resolution operator first line says call greet method yoda object argument dad second line says call greet method darth object argument mom also think lines like messages objects first tell yoda greet dad tell darth greet mom reason call variables like yoda darth objects abstract sense entities receive messages interact make calls variables name homeplanet correspond whichever object makes call yoda asked greet dad dagobah darth asked greet mom death star two calls generate screen output hello dad name yoda dagobah let friends ever hello mom name lord vader death star let friends ever exercise extend class declaration include method called mutate takes integer returns nothing write method definition mutate adds integer argument aliens number legs mutating accept negative arguments time alien numlegs drop zero solution constructors point notes written lecture terse likely make sense leaving doesn make sense remove first example class alien public char name maxstr char homeplanet maxstr int numlegs int isdeadly alien char nm char home int legs int deadly void greet char void mutate int morelegs alien alien char nm char home int legs int deadly strcpy name nm strcpy homeplanet home numlegs legs isdeadly deadly overloaded class alien public char name maxstr char homeplanet maxstr int numlegs int isdeadly alien alien char nm char home int legs int deadly void greet char void mutate int morelegs alien alien set reasonable defaults name homeplanet numlegs isdeadly alien alien char nm char home int legs int deadly strcpy name nm strcpy homeplanet home numlegs legs isdeadly deadly point call strcpy name instead two constructors talk decide call parameters types args typical overloaded function show example main function alien generra init values calls lame o constructor alien gamera gamera tokyo points ponder doesn generra would happen args constructor called default constructor good idea one probably want e g make array classes use assign one whole class another generra gamera also call constructor explicitly make anaonymous value certain type assign generra alien et home alien example use resolve name clash constructor alien alien char name char homeplanet int numlegs int isdeadly strcpy alien name name strcpy alien homeplanet homeplanet alien numlegs numlegs alien isdeadly isdeadly constant member class alien public const int killer const int lamb use killer lamb constants alien methods also use calls alien yoda yoda dagobah alien killer way hide magic number point non constants friday class public v private talk separation implementation interface would help example two different ways thing preferably something shown define impl intf idea provide common interface hides details implementation way replace code later also avoid things like yoda numlegs semantic error tell tell means give decls show accessors constructors void alien read char yorn cout cin ws cin getline name cout cin getline homeplanet cout cin numlegs cout cin yorn isdeadly toupper yorn y contrast void readinalien alien lifeform char yorn cout cin ws cin getline lifeform name cout cin getline lifeform homeplanet cout cin lifeform numlegs cout cin yorn lifeform isdeadly toupper yorn y accessor functions tips make member variables private define accessor functions use assignment
