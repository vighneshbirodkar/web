big source information almost history human civilization however recently information documents used propoerly poor structuring documents introduceion structured documents using tags markups majorly changed situation tagged electronic texts becoming widespread sources information markup languages sgml standard generalized markup language goldfarb charles introduced creating structured documents extracting information based structures documents still simple issue cases ad hoc based primitive word searches talk would introduce structured documents sgml discuss ways extracting information tagged documents particular present directions toward area would discussed along examples advantages disadvantages lincoln carr querying sgml documents standard generalized markup language sgml data
