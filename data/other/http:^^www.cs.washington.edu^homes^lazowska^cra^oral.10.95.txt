science engineering university washington chair government affairs committee computing research association u house representatives committee science subcommittee basic research hearing high performance computing communications program october mr chairman members subcommittee thank opportunity testify subject high performance computing communications program name ed lazowska head department computer science engineering university washington member recent national research council committee examine status hpcc initiative ivan sutherland testified also serve board directors computing research association today m represent members computing research association nearly industrial research laboratories academic programs computer science computer engineering nation cutting edge research graduate education fields takes place computing research association strongly endorses key findings nrc study discussed ivan sutherland testimony recap mind boggling progress information technology pervades aspects lives aspects economy nation leads information technology enjoys enormous competitive advantages america owns leadership today thanks complex interplay government academia industry record crystal clear government role also crystal clear industry afford look ahead years nation must invest long term large work takes place universities government support hpcc program major success emphasis high performance appropriate cutting edge information technology window future time machine emphasis parallel computing success much done viability clear many important problems areas science engineering tackled inter agency coordination cooperation working extremely well computing research association believes continued authorization hpcc program elements continued funding critical research areas continued strengthening inter agency process essential nation hpcc program nation research education program information technology hpcc coordinated multi agency initiative supports nearly nation fundamental research graduate education information technology hpcc much supercomputer centers although supercomputer centers multi dimensional make wide variety contributions science engineering astrophysics zoology including computer science engineering hpcc much highest performance systems although highest performance systems indeed time machines offering window onto future although path cutting edge desktop direct rapid hpcc systems software networking human resources technology applications nation information infrastructure information technology nation future hpcc program nation research education program information technology hpcc inter agency coordination model success maximize likelihood success risky endeavors requires multiple agencies multiple approaches agencies coordinated shouldn tightly managed lots specific examples successful coordination hpcc supercomputer centers gigabit testbeds digital library initiative strategic implementation plan national science technology council committee information communications beyond specific examples agencies nsf arpa fundamentally different complementary styles stood us good stead hpcc program proven appropriately flexible adaptable fundamental research nature unpredictable lewis clark exploring america geographical frontier strategic objective things didn always turn exactly planned false starts changes direction emphasis hpcc explore america technological frontier name stayed program evolved adapted focus software increased dramatically focus communications increased dramatically entire information infrastructure technology applications component added program increased emphasis research issues related horizontal scale ubiquity addition vertical scale performance hpcc proven ability adapt strategic plan future exists though much done much remains national science technology council committee information communications chaired anita jones testified last spring produced strategic implementation plan plan identified six strategic focus areas global scale information infrastructure technologies high performance scalable systems high confidence systems virtual environments user centered interfaces tools human resources education within areas critical core topics software computation communication infrastructure topics middleware support broad classes information infrastructure applications applications domains many federal agencies real technology drivers paradigm shift agents applications computational prototyping complete design prototyping computer leading reduced design time increased quality computing research association strongly endorses cic strategic planning effort directions identified role universities federal government critical historical track record clear course many decades federally supported university research played critical role essentially every aspect information technology timesharing computer networking workstations computer graphics database technology large scale integrated circuit design reduced instruction set computer architectures o subsystems based upon redundant arrays inexpensive disks parallel computing others serve person technical advisory board microsoft past five years microsoft discovered order create new markets needed new technologies areas data compression encryption networking d computer graphics operating systems statistical decision theory forth demonstrated brooks sutherland report without america research universities technologies would available spur world leadership universities look future hpcc program huge success allowing see future time machine phenomenon important emphasize university research carried hpcc program avoids picking winners losers purpose publicly funded research high technology fields advance knowledge create new opportunities industry exploit medium long term determine market develop universities transfer technology two ways transfer ideas granting patent licenses placing concepts public domain transfer people students faculty leave join form companies close industry university interactions facilitate technology transfer well exchange insights long term strategic directions pattern innovation technology transfer fluid interaction academia industry made america world leader information technology help us maintain critical lead summary mr chairman computing research association believes continued authorization hpcc program elements continued funding critical research areas continued strengthening inter agency process essential nation believe authorization flexible approach focused fundamental research broad range strategic areas allowing adaptation new research targets opportunity appear research areas described cic strategic plan provide excellent framework need increase focus software hpcc computation communication side need keep mind applications important research drivers paradigm shifters applications covered information infrastructure technology applications component hpcc program user centered interfaces tools component cic strategic plan understand extraordinary constraints subcommittee working federal investment information technology research though incredibly small compared payoff thank opportunity testify back computing research driving information technology
