continuous media data contrast commercial research approaches require specialized hardware operating systems networks usable technologies designing fit current research environment premise current hardware software communication infrastructure sufficient support research continuous media systems applications verifying hypothesis building working systems research storage systems directed towards building zeno distributed video file server zeno architecture uses network workstations connected generic local area network e g ethernet common environment computing research laboratories workstation act simultaneously client server continuous media data client workstation plays video stored one servers server workstation file server video data client receive video stored several servers server service several clients compared large centralized servers advantages design scalability new clients added new servers automatically added load balancing load generated serving videos distributed across machines across networks case servers located different networks low initial investment utilizing existing infrastructure zeno architecture promotes early adoption research environments almost initial investment research communication systems centered around best effort delivery protocols protocols built existing network protocols contrast many research efforts need reserve network resources establish connection resource reservation protocols well suited national communication infrastructure users charged per call basis bandwidth connections poorly suited network environments network shared resource equally accessible researchers approach appropriate latter environments commonly found research laboratories communication protocol developed called cyclic udp built top udp datagram protocol designed transport audio video data playback applications local metropolitan wide area networks cyclic udp used zeno file server deliver audio video data clients paper describing cyclic udp available online well slides research talk research processing video data two fold first developing algorithms process video data compressed representation processing video without decompression leads dramatic speed ups processing performance since removes time consuming processes compression decompression reduces amount data must processed experiments implementation ideas jpeg compressed image data indicates data processed one two orders magnitude faster possible previous approaches currently extending ideas parallelizing algorithms using networks workstations developing method transcoding video software video transcoding video translated one compression format another useful operation video file servers must service heterogeneous clients paper describing compressed domain processing available online research video processing also exploring methods simplify experimentation video processing developing programming language video first class data type language called rivl pronounced rival allows video processing effects specified independent resolution format source material language video postscript text graphics provides resolution independent method specifying video processing thus program process low quality quicktime video quickly editing decisions made used format high quality finished product line much way postscript previewed workstation low
