management knowledge leadership skills innovative technology product development environment driven identified expected customer needs resume postscript academic background dean graduated university virginia degree electrical engineering entered computer science ph d program georgia tech fall along way toward ph d dean received m computer science dean passed qualifying exams proposed thesis topic visualizing patterns interaction execution object oriented programs dynamic behavior object oriented programs difficult design implement modify understanding interactions classes objects necessary create efficient designs make safe modifications thesis work seeks identify visualize analyze recurring patterns interaction object oriented program executions means understanding examining dynamic behavior support directed toward design recovery validation reengineering tasks comparing existing design mental model specifications design level specifications reverse engineered implementation dean spent summer intern software production research department formerly bell laboratories naperville il currently part time consulting scientific atlanta inc dean hopes graduate march looking forward taking job industry academic research interests dean member software visualization research group specifically focused visualizing object oriented software interests include information visualization object oriented software engineering user interface design human computer interaction highlights dean research visualizing object oriented software object oriented approach program design made significant impact way software developed maintained programmers adopted object oriented approach order take advantage better data abstraction encapsulation reuse inheritance polymorphism work seeks help software developers testers maintainers understand dynamics object oriented systems many oo design techniques begin static object modeling dynamics object interactions important program operates course interactions difficult part system design understand additionally aspects system often less documented static counterparts approach use visualization convey information programmers systems available static analysis dynamic profiling key approach use patterns interaction entities system abstractions bridge gulf abstraction program design implementation first step process gather static information system generate trace files record system behavior analyzing behavior patterns interaction uncovered using various filtering abstraction techniques high level behavior extracted low level patterns graphical visualizations used present information programmers allow control filtering abstraction process abstract behavior compared design level information execution scenarios dynamic state models architectural models support thus directed toward design recovery validation tasks technical report visualizing message patterns object oriented program executions describes initial efforts extract visualize patterns messages oo systems history late dean built first prototype view visualizing execution c programs based work done groove system contains simple view inheritance hierarchy
