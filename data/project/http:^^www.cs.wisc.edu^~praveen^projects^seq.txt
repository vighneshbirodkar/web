management historical analysis economic social sciences metereology medical sciences biological sciences existing relational databases inadequate regard data collections treated sets sequences consequently expressing sequence queries tedious evaluating inefficient databases model data using abstraction sequences allow data sequences queried declarative manner utilizing ordered semantics take advantage unique opportunities available query optimization evaluation integrate sequence data relational data users store query combination relation sequences requirements serve goals seq project various kinds sequences need supported temporal sequences important kind queries expressible using notions like next previous natural considering sequences queries optimized evaluated efficiently issues need studied theory database system needs built demonstrates feasibility theoretical ideas project status current status project defined seq data model support important kinds sequence data also defined algebraic query operators composed form sequence queries analogous composition relational algebra operators form relation queries described sequence queries efficiently processed identified various optimization techniques use sequence query language sequin declaratively express queries sequences sequin query include embedded expressions relational query language like sql vice versa building disk based database system demonstrate feasibility proposals system implements seq model using nested complex object architecture built shore storage manager process several megabytes data relations sequences supported integrated extensible manner motivating example sequence query weather monitoring system records information various meteorological phenomena sequentiality occurrence phenomena various meteorological events sequenced time recorded scientist asks query volcano eruptions recent earthquake strength greater richter scale query expressed relational query language like sql complex features like groupby clauses correlated subqueries aggregate functions required conventional relational query optimizer would find efficient query execution plan even given knowledge earthquakes volcano relations sorted time however efficient plan exists one models data sequences ordered time two sequences scanned lock step similar sort merge join recent earthquake record scanned stored temporary buffer whenever volcano record processed value recent earthquake record stored buffer checked see strength greater possibly generating answer query therefore processed single scan two sequences using little memory key optimization sequentiality data query data model details seq data model described published paper click postscript version present gist basic model sequence set records mapped ordered domain positions many many relationship records positions viewed two dual distinct ways set records mapped position set positions mapped record two views called positional record oriented respectively gives rise set query operators based view queries sequences could require operators either flavors record oriented operators similar relational operators include various kinds joins overlap containment etc aggregates operators extensively explored researchers temporal database community positional operators include next previous offset moving aggregates etc operators allow zooming operations sequences means collapsing expanding ordering domains associated sequence instance daily sequence could zoomed e collapsed weekly sequence zoomed e expanded hourly sequence last part model deals operations groups e sets sequences advantage makes easy model queries involving sequence collections case many real world situations sequence operators extended work groups similar sequences instead single sequences extension seq model indicates practical implementation seq would probably involve nested complex object system sequin query language devised query language called sequin using declarative sequence queries specified language similar flavor sql except inputs queries well results queries sequences click description sequin language examples optimization techniques proposed new optimization techniques sequence queries involving positional operators existing techniques proposed queries record oriented operators optimizations use query transformations meta data caching intermediate results efficiently evaluate query optimal query evaluation plan generated using algorithm relies cost estimates one important observations accessing sequence data single stream probably efficient evaluation strategies take account details optimization techniques described published paper click postscript version system development seq database system client server architecture supporting multiple clients via multi threaded server server built top shore storage manager sequin subset sql supported query languages embedded inside data
