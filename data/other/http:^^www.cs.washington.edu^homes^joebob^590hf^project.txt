provides addressing resource naming conventions permit several kinds computer resources shared globally resources include hypertext hypermedia documents still images movies interactive menus buttons dialogs file transfer access resources available application software known web viewers browsers inherent centralized organization web result web indexes search mechanisms developed users free build hypertext index save pointers web pages lists e g mosaic hot list netscape bookmark feature lists controlled menus included browser interface nsf designated integration web browsers client workstation desktop research priority world wide web integration would eliminate lack symmetry user local files documents services available world wide web done right believe would assist user organization access content items found could easily found integrate desktop mean nsf research priorities explain detail phrase integrate desktop project assume desktop refers user interface software microsoft windows program manager file manager apple macintosh finder x windows window managers mwm twm user interfaces provide following services varying degress organize view present available files resources documents launch applications tasks projects permits user personalize workstation organize resources today today desktop interfaces different ways organizing displaying local web resources local resources hierarchical file systems hierarchical viewers d d nested folders program groups varying degrees support direct manipulation drag drop web resources hot list without limited nesting bookmarks without limited nesting menu driven dialog driven control write html pages problems discussing exactly meant integration browser desktop let list problems casual users seem using web case let also ask problem might appear distributed decentralized collection resources first noticed several problems watching user navigate web trying build set web pages serve topic tutorial support direct manipulation arrangement web views today browsers primitive mechanisms organizing web resources according personal preference hot lists hierarchical menu driven non visual bookmarks similar limitations marc andreeson inventor mosaic founder netscape admitted recent talk indexing navigational aides content organization quickly supersede current layout design issues ultimately user complete control content viewed cumbersome menus prohibit fly organization users often spend time finding page accessing web page ve seen quick painless people remember long url strings many people hotlists bookmarks help grow size become difficult manage brief experiment person instructed locate arrange web pages subject often locate page several times forgotten url users must remember type urls home page uses may conflict purpose home page organize owner view web purpose let others know owner owner interests goals preliminary user studies organization navigation focus ways user retains organizes access web documents studied novice web user next section ll try explain would work comments suggestions welcome later ll say regarding desktop metaphor following ideas guided design leverage interactions current desktop software visualize web similar storage devices like disks use icons represent web pages use hierachical nested views organized web pages provide direct manipulation operations web page icons activate icon launches pages icons generated saved desktop view paper prototype design ve included description drawings tour design user study prototype invited test subject play paper prototype observations suggestions described section discussion one sense integrating web access computer desktop really means integrating web objects applications desktop desktop serves organize launch computer resources support activity many common task initiated direct manipulation techniques move document onto icons representing available services like printer mailbox newer platforms capable supporting d interfaces see vrml hot java work could implemented d interface would take advantage perspective eye position viewing direction several d hierachy views could used visualize user organization web documents d visualization may useful navigation exploration web organization metaphors haven tried apply novel reality based metaphor may either curse blessing instead ve decided extend popular desktop metaphor feel metaphor several implementations assumed form life almost separate physical desktops computer users today part familiar desktop gui use folders organize directory trees proven useful desktops even though physical file folders often hierarchies envisioned extension metaphors attempts make network resources appear similar local resources already done extent prporietary networks research prototypes specifically web ve envisoned consistent standalone computer desktops need however address network delay reliability accessing network resources way would user accept asynchronous activities example would make sense delegate something agent dispatch ask interruption upon completion approach retains key problem interfacing large deep hierarchy items deep hierarchy hard see find file search tool usually provided help users find buried class mentioned several metaphors web access differ greatly desktop metaphor web ocean web highway example discussed metaphors decided use metaphors navigation browsing e g fishing trawling wandering road trip applied organization problem appear offer assistance real life cannot arrange ocean interstate highway system suit needs summary discussed several extensions approach drag drop mechanism could used connect documents objects services objects services could local remote example objects include movies audio pictures spreadsheets commodities sale services could include viewers word processors spreadsheet applications mailers printers fax software shopping purchasing software personal organizers web information structure could extended support additional object types would associate services objects similar mime concept default operations direct manipulation could associated service object combination desktop appears suitable way users organize personal views web seem provide ideal metaphor exploration navigation metaphors appropriate explorations still needed interface could support personal annotations overlaying document page post type annotations could stuck anywhere document would associated accessible document icon would stored locally attached whenever document referenced approach could suggest modifications web information structure html authors users often collect links page acts directory folder often pages content may contain personal annotations html extended incorporate directories folders instead logical types like ordered unordered lists browsing software viewers could support presentation metaphors suited organiztion reading extension would neither force authors use viewing software present differently document feel web viewing software easily enhanced support dynamic personalized organization leveraging existing desktop software natural way joseph m sherman last modified friday may th
