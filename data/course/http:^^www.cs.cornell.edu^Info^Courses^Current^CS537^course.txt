prerequisites textbook c information grading professor teaching assistants course description cs offered first time fall intended give students solid background design development database management systems dbms database systems possibly world largest pieces software certainly among valuable pieces software dbms one sense giant application program surprisingly many principles behind development use database industry growing thriving demand knowledgeable database engineers much greater supply database research community also active always new problems addressed explosive amounts data people wish access course forms essential background anyone wants become systems engineer database development company b become informed user database systems c become database systems researcher d develop systems domain manipulate large amounts data e find teller machine really works number advanced fundamental dbms concepts covered although intended introductory course new course may students class different backgrounds consequently discussion various topics begin quick review basic material taught cs click tentative list topics covered terms workload course involves midterm final examination test breadth basic concepts student survey paper specific advanced topic list possible topics purpose aware taught course fraction paper due three weeks midterm complete references require reading papers journals conference proceedings engineering library suggest initial references pursue additional references click information reference material library development project involving c programming look information written homework assignments students take turns writing lecture notes depending enrollment means person take notes twice semester hopefully additional work turn useful around exam time details ps development project term project important part course involve significant amount c programming choose whether wish work alone teams two however two person projects involve proportionally work goal project two fold get hands experience building specific dbms component b get comfortable working large pre existing code base modifying modular manner second goal important first one database systems huge software systems rarely luxury starting scratch forces write modular code also understand interaction different system components inevitable bugs appear two research dbms prototypes used projects one minibase software associated textbook simple single user database system provides components sql parser disk manager hopefully available depending able compile run computing environment important part minibase interface description various system components actual code comes class projects consequently projects using minibase involve writing component like buffer manager based specification c interface prototype predator query processing engine developing research number possible projects could lead research topics built top predator focus high end functionality like complex queries new data types familiar c recommend minibase project amount design needed minimal think interested database systems research predator project fall neither category decide whether want project lower level dbms storage access buffer areas higher level query processing optimization areas choose minibase lower level predator higher level also general projects involve neither system idea suitable project talk well advance project proposal date tentative list possible projects projects certain steps followed part project proposal discuss submit ordered list pieces functionality project produce mid project review meet discuss progress made towards completing project code write must follow coding conventions particular system working detailed coding conventions document provided followed closely something picky contribute grade get project project submission include demo reasonable amount test data useful references home page predator home page
