diagnosis prognosis bibliography citation popular press local related links related links diagnosis work grew desire dr wolberg accurately diagnose breast masses based solely fine needle aspiration fna identified nine visually assessed characteristics fna sample considered relevant diagnosis collaboration prof mangasarian two graduate students rudy setiono kristin bennett classifier constructed using multisurface method msm pattern separation nine features successfully diagnosed new cases resulting data set well known wisconsin breast cancer data image analysis work began addition nick street research team goal diagnose sample based digital image small section fna slide results research consolidated software system known xcyt currently used dr wolberg clinical practice diagnosis process performed follows fna taken breast mass material mounted microscope slide stained highlight cellular nuclei portion slide cells well differentiated scanned using digital camera frame grabber board user isolates individual nuclei using xcyt using mouse pointer user draws approximate boundary nucleus using computer vision approach known snakes approximations converge exact nuclear boundaries interactive process takes two five minutes per slide image showing xcyt use nuclei isolated fasion program computes values ten characteristics nuclei measuring size shape texture mean standard error extreme values features computed resulting total nuclear features sample based training set cases linear classifier constructed differentiate benign malignant samples classifier consists single separating plane space three features extreme value area extreme value smoothness mean value texture projecting cases onto normal separating plane approximate probability densities benign malignant points constructed allow simple bayesian computation probability malignancy new patients densities shown patient allowing judge confidence diagnosis comparison hundreds previous samples date system correctly diagnosed consecutive new patients benign malignant eight cases xcyt return suspicious diagnosis estimated probability malignancy small subset source images used research found good test cases image segmentation object recognition algorithms pet segmentation algorithm automatically identify nuclei images please email street cs wisc edu let work together prognosis second problem considered research prognosis prediction long term behavior disease approached prognosis function approximation problem using input features including computed xcyt predict time recurrence malignant patients using right censored data solution termed recurrence surface approximation method rsa utilizes linear program construct surface predicts time recurrence new patients examining actual recurrence training cases similar predicted recurrence times plot probability disease free survival various times years individual patient capability incorporated xcyt example shown survival curves plot probability disease free survival versus time years black disease free survival curve represents patients original study red curve represents probability disease free survival sample case particular case therefore average prognosis probability disease free years equal rsa procedure also used compare predictive power various prognostic factors results indicate precise detailed cytological information type provided xcyt gives better prognostic accuracy traditional factors tumor size lymph node status corroborated researchers result could remove need often painful
