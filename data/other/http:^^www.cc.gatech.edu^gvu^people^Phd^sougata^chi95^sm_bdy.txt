foley cc gatech edu hudson cc gatech edu abstract work concerns visualizing information space hypermedia systems using multiple hierarchical views although overview diagrams useful helping user navigate hypermedia system real world system become complicated large really useful diagrams represent complex network structures difficult visualize comprehend hand effective visualizations hierarchies developed strategy provide user different hierarchies giving different perspective underlying information space help user better comprehend information propose algorithm based content structural analysis form hierarchies hypermedia networks algorithm automatic guided user multiple hierarchies visualized various ways give examples implementation algorithm two hypermedia systems keywords hypermedia overview diagrams information visualization hierarchization introduction overview diagrams one best tools orientation navigation hypermedia documents presenting map underlying information space allow users see information available access information however real world hypermedia system many nodes links overview diagrams represent large complex network structures generally shown d d graphs comprehending large complex graphs extremely difficult layout graphs also difficult problem attempts visualize networks semnet successful parunak notes insight hypermedia hyperbase structured set distinguishable hierarchies offer navigational cognitive benefits equally complex system undifferentiated links even union hierarchies hierarchical neuwirth et al also observed ability view knowledge different perspectives important thus different hierarchies gives different perspective underlying information formed user would able comprehend information better also noted unlike networks effective ways visualizing hierarchies developed examples treemaps cone trees paper proposes algorithm forming hierarchies hypermedia graphs uses structural content analysis identify hierarchies structural analysis looks structure graph content analysis looks contents nodes note content analysis assumes database oriented hypermedia system nodes described attributes although algorithm automatic forming best possible hierarchy representing graph user guide process hierarchies giving different perspectives underlying information formed hierarchies visualized different ways section presents hierarchization process section shows implementation algorithm navigational view builder system building visualizing information space hypermedia systems section discusses application algorithm demo automobile database section world wide web section discusses hierarchies transformed forms data organizations section talks related work section conclusion hierarchization process new data structure hierarchization process use data structure call pre tree pre tree intermediate graph tree node called root parent node however unlike real tree descendants need trees may arbitrary graph descendants thus form list graphs called branches however one restriction nodes different branches cannot links example pre tree shown figure note pre tree another data structure like multi trees complex graph simple tree also note although term pre tree used data structure long history top clustering techniques top clustering would often halted new divisions auspicious leaving final structure essentially pre tree figure example pre tree root node parent descendants root node graphs however none graphs links hierarchization algorithm tries identify best pre tree represent given graph final tree formed calling algorithm recursively branches hierarchization algorithm algorithm tries identify suitable pre tree given graph thus root node identified nodes partitioned branches root node forms root final hierarchy algorithm recursively called branches trees formed recursive calls become children root final hierarchy recursion stops branch nodes required depth final tree reached may also happen certain branches suitable pre trees formed cases nodes branches become children parent branch case generally occurs branches nodes identifying potential pre trees content structural analysis used content analysis content analysis attribute nodes graph partitioned branches based attribute values content based clustering clustering algorithm explained many branches formed attribute suitable forming pre tree otherwise new pre tree formed branches root pre tree cluster representing nodes graph structural analysis pre tree formed nodes graph reach nodes nodes designated roots pre trees branches branches spanning tree formed breadth first search designated root node detailed analysis omitted purpose brevity algorithm explained examples next section content structural analysis identify several potential pre trees metric used rank pre trees metric consists following submetrics information lost formation pre tree nodes partitioned forming branches links joining nodes different branches removed thus valuable information lost submetric calculates ratio number links remaining branches total number links original graph rank pre trees order least amount information lost treeness branches since overall objective form trees advantageous branches pre tree already close trees branches consisted trees would total n c links n total number nodes branches c number connected components thus submetric calculates ratio n c l l total number links indication treeness branches goodness root structural pre tree goodness root determined sum distances shortest path root nodes good root reach nodes following links resulting tree deep deep tree desirable since force user follow long tedious path reach information content analysis goodness root determined relevance attribute example automobile database manufacturer cars relevant attribute number doors cars submetric returns number overall metric calculated weighted sum submetrics weight determined relative importance submetrics role user default entire process would automatically forming best hierarchical form original graph however user guide process translation graph tree visualization tree translation phase users control various variables used translation process example control variable specifies maximum possible depth tree recursion stops depth reached user control relative importance various submetrics overall metric used rank given pre tree example user specify goodness root useful criteria judging pre trees user also assign different weights different link types influence submetric calculating amount information lost algorithm generally selects best possible pre tree level however user choose pre tree instead user shown possible pre trees selected ranked metric user choose one user specify level hierarchy pre trees would chosen choosing different pre trees different runnings algorithm different hierarchies giving different perspectives data formed visualization phase besides d tree hierarchy also visualized cone trees treemaps table contents book formed listing nodes order depth first search different visual attributes bound information attributes views

structural analysis similar described identifying hierarchies hypermedia structures although using structural analysis identify hierarchies works hypertext systems simpler underlying structures identifying meaningful hierarchies structural analysis alone difficult real world systems content analysis also essential evident paper describes method linearize complex hyper networked nodes facilitate browsing using book metaphor however work also uses structural analysis paper also related systems deal graphical presentation information automatically semi automatically examples include apt sage however information domain different systems systems deal highly structured information views want develop also different previous systems generally produced bar diagrams scatter plots graph
