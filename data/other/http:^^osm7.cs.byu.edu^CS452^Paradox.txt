primary key sid number primary key address char similar concept followed paradox method creating tables identify attributes data types key attributes give table relation scheme name creating relation schemes paradox windows select file new table menu bar e file followed new table table type paradox windows default enter following field name type alphanumeric short number integer d date format mm dd yy size alphanumeric types specify whether key attribute key attributes must top field list student example sid name combined primary key listed first two fields specify field key part key press key keyboard column click mouse button column cursor positioned column click save button enter name file tables automatically given db file extension extension specified recommended use default extension ms dos select menu bar create enter name table created similar step windows version enter field name field type data types dos windows however data type size key attribute area entered field type column hence attribute part primary key alphanumeric type size characters field type press f doit save table note paradox requires key fields come first b adding tuples table windows select file open table menu bar pick table want insert data select table edit data menu bar press f enter data appropriate columns finished entering data select table end edit press f table new values automatically saved edit session ended ms dos table edited present desktop select modify edit form menu bar enter name table edit insert data appropriate columns press f doit save table table already visible desktop need re open table click table press f allow editing table hit f save modifications made table building queries building queries qbe paradox similar ones given textbook exceptions discussed section bringing skeleton tables qbe query built skeleton tables relation involved query must selected windows select file new query menu bar window appear names available tables select table involved query tables involved query select query add table menu bar select tables involved query repeat step table wish query ms dos select ask menu bar enter names tables involved query repeat tables involved query b performing projections windows ms dos select table containing attributes want project table already desktop click anywhere table otherwise open using arrow keys keyboard mouse select attribute field want project hit f key click little white box field check appear field remove check hit f key field repeat steps fields want project c performing selections windows ms dos select table containing attributes want select table already desktop click anywhere table otherwise open select attribute fields using arrow keys mouse enter comparison operator followed comparing value either constant another variable valid relational comparison operators include optional d performing joins windows ms dos select table joined table already desktop click anywhere table otherwise open select attribute field joined enter variable field variables must preceded underscore windows variable appear red underscore shown repeat steps tables whose attributes want join e performing set queries qbe uses set command every attribute field perform queries find employee makes money others find customer ordered none books type query need first create set tuples comparison compare set another table perform selections projections grouping explained following example suppose wish find employees work departments first need create set departments dno department location table follow steps select dep loc table type set field table name select field dno grouped set tuples enter variable dno field need compare set dno departments employee table find employees work none departments continue follows select employee table select field dno employee table compare set enter every field followed variable dno following query specification p represents check mark first table establishes set dno second table prints names employees associated every dno set dep loc dep name dno set dno employee name emp dno p every dno set comparison operators every exactly values group contain members defined set example customers ordered one book travel series values group defined set example patients ward haven exhibited symptom seen patients ward every values group include members defined set example students taken courses required major chemistry exactly values group exactly match members defined set combines every example customers ordered books travel series others f performing multiple sub queries table table skeleton multiple horizontal lines perform multiple sub queries table entering first query table use arrow move next line perform second sub query repeated queries table suppose example want query employees supervised compute scientist would involve two queries employee relation one select computer scientists supervisors another compare employee set computer scientists supervisors following query demonstrates employee table used twice query emp emp sup degree eno computer science p eno g executing saving queries windows query desktop e needs read file click file open query menu bar select qbe file opened execute query desktop select query run menu bar ms dos queries cannot loaded saved hence queries must built desktop press f doit execute chosen
