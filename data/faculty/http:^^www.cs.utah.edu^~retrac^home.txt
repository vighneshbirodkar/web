collaborators dilip khandekar linus kamb copy slides osdi tutorial distributed shared memory minus graphs incorporate soon significant past research projects munin distributed shared memory system munin first software distributed shared memory system explore potential performance benefits using relaxed consistency model among munin novel features software implementation release consistency model first multiple writer memory consistency protocol address problem false sharing support multiple consistency protocols including user supplied protocols update timeout mechanism reduce communication overhead write update protocols shared memory programs moderate high degrees sharing munin achieved far greater performance speedup conventional distributed shared memory systems usually within hand coded message passing performance many features ideas first developed munin appeared subsequent dsm systems primary research collaborators willy zwaenepoel john bennett copy dissertation
