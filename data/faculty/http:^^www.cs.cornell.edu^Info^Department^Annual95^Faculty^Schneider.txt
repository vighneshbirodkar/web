techniques understanding concurrent programs becoming increasingly important distributed computing systems become widespread mission critical applications research focused development techniques heavily involved applying assertional reasoning design concurrent distributed fault tolerant real time programs completing textbook subject along david gries continue investigations concerning first order equational logic e past year streamlined inference rules evaluated number techniques handling undefined terms partial functions thomas bressoud completed building analyzing hypervisor based implementation replication management hp pa risc architecture protocols ensure sequence instructions executed two virtual machines running different physical processors identical protocols also coordinate o issued virtual machines use hypervisor implement replica coordination attractive least theory replica coordination implemented hypervisor instantly becomes available hardware realizations given instruction set architecture including realizations exist hypervisor written second replica coordination implemented hypervisor single implementation suffices every operating system executes instruction set architecture finally implementing replica coordination hypervisor applications programmer freed task jointly dag johansen university troms norway robbert van renesse started tacoma
