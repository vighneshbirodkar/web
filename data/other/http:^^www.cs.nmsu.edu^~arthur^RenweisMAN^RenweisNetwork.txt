purposes cable television systems catv already place much u provide interesting potentially useful platform distribution digital data metropolitan area scale catv systems use initially designed one way communications plan use must include either upgrading currently installed upstream amplifiers actual implementation problems associated using types facilities studied demonstrated using facilities technically economically feasible karshmer thomas phelan karshmer thomas studies along others hatamain hafez demonstrated potential strengths weaknesses using systems possibly greatest strength using catv based networks almost universal existence u approximately homes currently connected cable plant virtually every building cities passed cable one key problems associated using branching tree topology cable plant access control due separation upstream downstream channels message source node leaf must sent upstream head end downstream destination node another leaf round trip time cause large delay message transmission reception render access control technique csma cd useless current work present results analysis system reduces message transmission time two way catv network decreasing network throughput develop model two level catv networking scheme tested using well know simulation techniques finally simulation results analyzed compared best throughput expected delay times distributed switching single trunk catv network figure shows simplified view two level single trunk catv network m switches installed trunk switch turn connected branch cable supports k branch nodes network subscribers trunk node switch three inputs trunk upstream trunk downstream branch upstream well three outputs branch node one output branch upstream one input branch downstreamsince trunk nodes certain level intelligence traffic flow trunk totally controlled goal intelligent trunk nodes turn around messages onto appropriate branch cable earliest possible time head end therefore node redirect messages system able redirect messages earliest possible time believe system reduce message travel time reduce message delay increase system throughput figure shows simulation results m k node case different node distribution trunk branch cables distributions trunk node branch nodes trunk nodes nodes per branch trunk nodes nodes per branch trunk nodes nodes per branch trunk nodes nodes per branch figure shows delays related different distributions following figure shows packet length bits baud rate mbps figure shows fixed baud rate mbps fixed packet size bits throughput total number packets branch cable almost identical therefore total throughput system within given time expressed following equation value num packets per branch almost identical values g branch cable seems clear putting control node trunk cable linearly increase throughput entire network case implementation intelligent node trunk cable resulted desired performance since slotted aloha double throughput branch see total throughput also doubled implies better protocol branch level total system throughput increases figure shows delay time may reduced even number trunk control nodes increases following equation shows de lay mainly caused two factors size waiting queue retransmission rate g queuing theory would predict many messages trunk control nodes waiting transmitted delay increase means traffic greater trunk capacity store forward protocol truck level cause long delay deteriorate overall system performance conclusions results current study lead us number conclusions regarding use two level distributed intelligence approach using catv equipment support metropolitan area networking briefly stated adding control nodes trunk cable increasing m reduce delay number uses subscribers system fixed proper values average transmission success rate average transmission attempts g also tend increase throughput increasing baud rate tends reduce packet time therefore positive effect reducing waiting queue size turn reduces delay see figure interestingly increasing baud rate beyond certain limit tends cause waiting queue size increase consequently packet time reduced delay time increases see figure essentially ability reduce delay time function trunk cable transmit rate bit rate packet length increasing value m cause delay time increased throughput branch effectively fixed normal distribution probability therefore nodes users branch less frequently branch node send packet onto branch cable throughput branch fixed result extent trunk node handle traffic waiting queue size increase delay time increase model clearly demonstrates design extendable increase number users simply adding trunk control nodes increase system throughput without increasing average system delay important result tells us small number trunk nodes inexpensive simple install dramatic impact overall network performance results obtained using baud rate mbps using realistic figure range mbps could enhance findings
