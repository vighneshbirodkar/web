acquisition novel machine learning problem cynthia thompson raymond j mooney submitted thirteenth international conference machine learning icml paper defines new machine learning problem standard machine learning algorithms cannot easily applied problem occurs domain lexical acquisition ambiguous synonymous nature words causes difficulty using standard induction techniques learn lexicon additionally negative examples typically unavailable difficult construct domain one approach solve lexical acquisition problem presented along preliminary experimental results artificial corpus future work includes extending algorithm performing tests realistic corpus corpus based lexical acquisition semantic parsing cynthia thompson ph d proposal building accurate efficient natural language processing nlp systems important difficult problem increasing interest automating process lexicon mapping words meanings one component typically difficult update changes one domain next therefore automating acquisition lexicon important task automating acquisition nlp systems proposal describes system wolfie word learning interpreted examples learns lexicon input consisting sentences paired representations meanings preliminary experimental results show system learn correct useful mappings correctness evaluated comparing known lexicon one learned training input usefulness evaluated examining effect using lexicon learned wolfie assist parser acquisition system previously lexicon hand built future work form extensions algorithm evaluation possible applications discussed inducing

university texas austin july new system learning induction called lab presented lab learning abduction learns abductive rules based set training examples goal find small knowledge base used

given set symptoms manifestations want output set disorders explain manifestations present training example associated potentially multiple categories instead one case typical learning systems building knowledge base requires choice multiple possibilities number possibilities grows exponentially number training examples one method choosing best knowledge base described implemented final
