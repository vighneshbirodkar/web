portable next generation bit windows operating system even radically different architecture windows nt provides backward compatibility ms dos windows os posix applications even non intel processors windows nt designed extensible possible borrowing design cmu mach windows nt consists priviledged executive set non priviledged servers called protected subsystems nt design unique protected subsystems execute user mode like applications structure allows protected subsystems modified added without affecting integrity executive addition protected subsystems nt provides modular executive easily extended nt represents system resources objects modified object specific apis new system objects added without undermining existing objects nt supports drivers changed system running nt support new file systems devices networks transport protocols simply writing new driver rpc built nt application call remote services without regard location network new services added machine network made available immediately windows nt designed portable possible written primarily c small portions written c parts written assembler must directly talk hardware carefully isolated rest system means variety cpus run nt including intel x mips powerpc alpha chips nt run systems one processors windows nt provides several machanisms increase reliability nt responds predictably error conditions even caused hardware failures structured exception handling used catch software errors whenever abnormal event occurs exception handling code exists throughout system automatically invoked response condition ensuring undetected error wreaks havoc user programs system addition nt implements new file system called ntfs recover kinds disk errors including critical disk sectors uses redundancy transaction based scheme storing data ensure recoverability nt security measures c class government certified finally windows nt designed fast component written eye towards performance protected subsystem optimized maximize speed frequently used system calls increase speed communication protected subsystems local procedure call facilities provided integral part os finally networking built windows nt achieve best possible performance summary windows nt thoroughly modern full featured highly compatible operating system beyond mostly taken section helen custer inside windows nt microsoft press windows nt gap performance typical pc sparc machines grown smaller smaller time operating systems pc grown advanced number reasons moving nt current unix based environment include results csrvl work immediately usable large growing win user base outside cornell also basic hardware run nt higher performance price ratio many sparc machines available another advantage using os low end pentium pcs way smp risc machines moving nt notes moving nt number issues involved moving research csrvl windows nt software hardware hurdles need leap researchers productive work nt note want make anyone use nt familiar unix reasons work unix another option work csrvl interoperability existing unix investment important hardware right csrvl populated mostly sparc ipc ipx systems sparcstation machines pc

ongoing csrvl could benefit windows nt spatial energy histograms many applications color histograms used compare images advantages efficiency insensitivity small changes camera viewpoint chief drawback lack spatial information lead images different appearances similar histograms describe histogram based method comparing images incorporates spatial information mpeg browser scene break detector could view mpegs like could watch movies unfortunately unable take advantage digital format seen mpeg players allowing user skip arbitrary frame fast forward rewind etc even importantly video basically sequence frames structure obvious video higher structure frames partition video shots scenes larger chunks like movies tv shows etc also partition video accoding content example might want select segment video particular actor appears mpeg browse provides interface browsing video user play video stop arbitrary point fast forward advantage mpeg browse video players mpeg browse adds limited yet useful structure video partitions video shots based information browser skip next shot much like cd player skip next song scene break algorithm developed ramin zabih justin miller kevin
