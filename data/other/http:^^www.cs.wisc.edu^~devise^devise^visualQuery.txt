introduction session represent data visualize place graphics command summary introduction database environment users ask questions formulating queries underlying database query output answers questions questions asked different sets input data principle applies graphics used represent data difference visual queries formulated using graphical user interface graphical data formulating visual queries users start set input data graphical representations input data generated perhaps extensive experimentations users would navigate data look places interest sometimes users might need additional help looking original data represented graphics state visualization environment forms visual query like database query visual query saved applied different sets input data visual query constructed manipulating system components devise create component instances interconnections components derived model visualization visual query interface manipulates components allow user specify data visualized data visualized place graphics display session state visual query stored session sessions accessed session menu following menu items open restore previously saved visual query original state open template apply previously saved visual query different set input data user selects new input data session restored close close current session save save visual query file restored later save save visual query different name save template save visual query template print print contents window save postscript quit quit devise represent data following commands used specify user wants visualize define mapping edit mapping controlling shape size define mapping visualize define command lets user define new data streams tdata new visualizations system steps required create new visualization summarized select data stream pulling source selector select open command bottom selector define new data stream click auto run automatic mapping utility select attributes visualization dialog box including x attribute one y attributes window name layout options click ok create new visualization edit mapping view edit mapping menu command allows user experiment mapping gdata view dialog box appears allowing user edit mapping dynamic nature editing mapping valuable data exploration effectiveness graphics may vary different locations data different zoom factors well user change attributes visualization including x y color shape size pattern orientation attributes optional parameters shape width height also defined controlling shape pixel size sometimes size shapes small appear single pixels drawn inside view often desirable accentuate shapes enlarging sizes bigger single pixel controlling actual size pixel sized shapes done via keyboard commands directed view key increases size shapes key decreases size shapes visualize many ways specify user wants look control panel widgets layout versus display mode axes mouse keyboard events history window visual link

changes view visual filter undo edit button used undo editing back one button goes back one step history changes current view visual filter clicking use moves back one step clicking undo cancels change clicking history widget brings history window layout vs display modes devise two modes operation layout display modes users toggle two modes clicking button layout mode user constructs mappings views decides place views windows without graphics update window windows eventually updated user switches display mode placing devise layout mode time saver large amounts data involved layout mode allows user construct visual query without waiting graphics updated otherwise adding view window may cause views already window together linked views windows updated simultaneously may take long time

display history window history window accessed clicking history button control panel history changes visual filter current view displayed users go back places previously visited clicking history window entry clicking use button control panel users also mark unmark places interest clicking mark column history window marked entries preceded history window finite size old history entries replaced new ones size history window reaches maximum however marked entries never replaced visual link visual links used link axes multiple views scrolling zooming one synchronously scrolls zooms linked views view link menu brings dialog box allows user select link current view dialog box also allows user create new links examine views belong existing links view unlink menu allows user dissociate view link cursor click example cursors used display boundaries one view relative another clicking destination view moves cursor clicked region time changing visual filter source view cursor

scrolling zooming user might come across location interest data cases user wants see location looks like different set input data accomplished view switch tdata menu command time save eliminating need use mapping definition difference different input used duplicate window consider window consisting set linked views user navigates views might come across location interest one way save location mark history window however user may also want compare two separate locations easily accomplished making copy window two may placed side side comparison done choosing window duplicate window menu command duplicating window user provided two identical windows user use first window reference point using second window navigation find places interest data querying user navigates data might places information records used generate graphics becomes important understanding pressing middle button may used query data underly mouse result pop window appears giving user information data records including attribute names values click example event much information fit pop window information displayed textually user terminal place graphics views windows means user decides place graphics first views removed windows reduce clutter moved windows side side comparison views functions accessed view remove window view bring back window menus placed within window positions views may also swapped using view swap position menu windows responsible arranging views inside boundaries different placement strategies may implemented currently devise offers three window layouts tiled automatic vertical
