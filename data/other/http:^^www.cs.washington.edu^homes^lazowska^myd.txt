department computer science engineering university washington september released conference board study research doctorate programs united states includes measure program labeled median years degree widely interpreted median number years students spend graduate program fooled fact study reports best described median number years elapse student first enters educational program field institution receiving bachelors degree student receives ph d suppose example student enters masters program immediately receiving bachelors degree graduates masters program years student enters workforce years wanting make transition research perhaps entirely different field masters degree student enrolls ph d program graduates years later ph d granting institution probably feels pretty good cranked student years conference board study student weigh years semantic confusion one issue attribute particular semantics myd measure actually represents careful definition myd would reduce confusion somewhat many would still confused misleading title even semantic confusion could cleared opinion myd measure convey information characterizes meaningful way graduate program attached relevant student trying choose graduate programs administrator looking bloated programs might even argue represent something worth tabulating reporting confusing looking broadly individual graduate programs question whether myd even germane field whole since many factors contribute measure background department computer science engineering university washington routinely calculate median time students spend doctoral program number stable years decade require masters degree en route ph d number represents total time graduate school student enters directly bachelors program tricky semantics exactly d expect therefore surprised new conference board study reported years myd program spurred mit noticed similar phenomenon explored first step calculate median time spent program graduates specific years considered conference board study using database confirmed value year range next help graduate school obtained data directly nrc survey earned doctorates actual data used input conference board study graduating students fill sed form sent nrc sed form asks student wide range data year high school graduation years attendance every college including year graduate institution student spent time full time equivalent years student since receipt first bachelors degree etc course glitches among odd graduates multi year reporting interval overall return rate high quality data good calculated variety measures data formed variety hypotheses finally nrc staff provided essential assistance re working calculations program reviewing us without assistance way beyond call duty would still speculating data gathering analysis study responsibility nrc office scientific engineering personnel looks human resource issues across science engineering fields myd really means noted preamble myd measure conference board study widely interpreted median number years students spend graduate program fact median number years elapse student first enters educational program field institution receiving bachelors degree student receives ph d disciplines instances significant employment occurs receipt masters degree entry ph d program difference huge measure ve ever calculated graduate program measure consider particularly germane surely time spent fully employed part career plan receiving masters degree institution enrolling graduate program characteristic graduate program pushing bit harder even obvious time spent masters program elsewhere germane since require masters degree en route ph d students regardless background enter program even footing terms checkpoints program far greatest source discrepancy myd figure reported conference board study intuition graduate program worth noting though even use conference board myd definition calculate measure database obtain somewhat different results conference board study several secondary contributing factors may interest first conference board study calculates integer number years student subtracting calendar year entry calendar year exit student enters september year x graduates january year x actually spent years program reported small consistent effect since students first enroll fall worth noting context study arrives myd reported two decimal digits students fall median year considered graduated uniformly across year based upon offset within year calculated two digits reported second students occasionally mis code case program four students coded computer engineering rather computer science attributed electrical engineering department study offset four students d never heard coded computer science third students omit essential fields sed form must course omitted calculation affected non negligible number graduates simplicity explanation presented context university washington department computer science engineering applies programs surveyed conference board study lessons state definitions precisely conference board study document one would unlikely discern definition myd implications avoid using titles assumed many mean something really reported better choose title obvious semantics one wrong obvious semantics mindful correct definitions making statements statements conference board study document took graduates longer earn degree average graduates programs took years earlier would seem contribute misinterpretation consider appropriateness measures understanding definition myd allow community consider appropriate measure sed form includes wide variety data myd measure conference board study chosen calculate use confuse accuracy precision conference board study reports two decimal digits widely misunderstood measure lots fuzz handling survey instruments difficult coding errors inevitable community wants reliable analyses going take time verify providing reliable data acknowledgements jeff dean graduate student department noticed anomalous figure reported us immediately computing research association placed conference board study computer science information web
