date tue jan gmt server ncsa content type text html last modified mon jun gmt content length authoring world wide web home pages pc users authoring world wide web home pages pc page maintained supported kevin treu department computer science please feel free write treu kevin furman furman edu questions suggestions overviewby time probably experience basic web surfing using netscape thus appreciate amount information easily accessible makes web truly exciting however ease contribute workshop explore firsthand basics hypertext markup language html used create home pages see include digitized images find load pages accessible entire internet community introducing concept html process producing pages web surprisingly simple become familiar basic concepts ll find document preparation web easy presently find word processing hopefully good thing home page authoring employs hypertext markup language html ll address meaning hypertext part shortly markup part key simplicity html reveals fact documents created merely adding special characters called tags basic text files marking begin start netscape find page interest page go first select source view menu suddenly find looking screen full characters probably look familiar others probably looking html file processed netscape program create page looking executed source command goal page make perfect sense end workshop let start explore language first part workshop ll create sample personal page diskette alternatively work hard disk computer obvious reasons shouldn public lab b create subdirectory diskette called web use windows utility notepad begin editing home page save web directory name index htm reasons explained later save diskette hard drive lab contents simple text including name first line class year major second campus address phone number e mail address subsequent lines list classes term paragraph describing extracurricular activities interests note word processor would suitable purpose long save files text ascii format key special control characters regulate margins indenting fonts styles etc word processor meaning web c editing file save start netscape note keep netscape notepad running one time use alt tab key sequence toggle running applications ll see fledgling home page looks like go file menu select open file resulting dialog box permits open file pc disk html document navigate diskette open index htm kind mess right notice netscape ignores tabs carriage returns sequences spaces etc simply takes characters produced runs together done next marking text tags course proceed discuss fact html indeed limited language present time expect able kinds fancy formatting like word processor html least current incarnation version html due soon pretty nice new features though however probably already know web explorations fairly eye catching presentations created let start see beginning html tags almost html tags following format tag text possibly including tags tag ll see notable exceptions general always think tags coming pairs first set tags ll consider general structure tags used identify certain parts document though strictly required browsers reflect good html style ll start briefly structure tags include html used bracket entire document head identifies prologue file typically including title body identifies main content document d change context netscape notepad edit file edit looks like html head head body ve written far body html e next add title every web page needs brief descriptive title becomes accessible various web searchers identifies pages stored bookmarks lists go menu displayed top netscape window accessed uses guessed title tag title title page title placed head tags edit file include appropriate title jane doe personal page forget save file f switch back netscape view page netscape click reload button cause changes made take effect won notice much different time except title included top netscape window let start making page bit presentable start would certainly like separate logically related passages text one another probably identifying appropriate subtitles like outline paper heading tags h h h take care nicely g surround name class year h tag pairs example h jane doe h h junior english major h proceed placing subtitles document section using h headers h address information h address stuff wrote h class schedule h class stuff wrote h activities interests h activity stuff wrote save file use netscape check document use reload button little better note heading tags numbered according size level one h tags largest level six h tags smallest effective outline style presentations easily constructing using try experimenting different sizes turning attention specific contents section document would least like separate lines text intended different lines two tags notable examples tags come pairs used p paragraph br line break tags whereever placed document cause character immediately following begin new line case paragraph tag blank line inserted next character displayed line break tag simply causes new text next line h insert line break tags line address phone number information classes last item section insert paragraph tag example room number br box number br phone br e mail address p check file netscape things shaping note class activity information ll get shortly adding links documents far ve seen html good word processor makes special though ability include hypertext links web pages produces highlighted words images page take somewhere else computer halfway around world single click fortunately links simply implemented html employ tags like already seen general format link href resource url text image easy basic familiarity universal resource locators urls assumed workshop brief however url one http furman edu treu cheers html breaks follows http identifies resource accessed hypertext page furman edu identifies machine address internet treu cheers html identifies path resource numerous variations urls resource identifier may things besides http instance notice options net travels sometimes path may omitted well file name certain paths file names accepted defaults netscape web browsers ll soon see defaults system important point note urls come two forms absolute relative easier two understand absolute form short absolute url one fully specified including http another resource identifier machine name previous example absolute url specification urls sometimes simplified using relative form possible whenever link another resource computer included short resource identifier machine address omitted case long netscape figure resource based currently need specify terms url minimal example currently accessing page directory treu want access cheers page relative url simply reduces cheers html simplify matters remember use relative urls creating links pages use absolute urls creating links pages elsewhere web let add link two home page many people include list interesting web sites personal pages let start list sample page near end file body tag insert following h links check h href http cool infi net cool site day p use netscape open file see words cool site day highlighted blue created first link clicking text take interesting web site visited try j find write urls interesting pages add new links list also make link text page see find web page dedicated one activities interests make key word activity paragraph link page presumably go create pages need create file ends htm web directory create link instance say create page containing information favorite band store page band htm directory index htm file create link need something like href band htm favorite band compare use relative url absolute form used thus far much simpler right band htm stored place index htm k try create new page ending htm using notepad save web directory contents page unimportant create link new page index htm file try ll soon see images text made links well e mail link popular web page feature link allows someone quickly easily send e mail author particular page add one page l surround e mail address tag using mailto indicator name jane doe would add href mailto doe jane furman furman edu doe jane furman furman edu tt bit html moving inclusion images document lets apply bit polish using additional features html horizontal rules already separated different segments page using subtitles often non text separator also desirable purpose html includes facility including horizontal rules dividers implemented using another non pair tag hr stands horizontal rule m prior level two heading h include tag hr check effect using netscape lists probably clear web travels workshop far information often best organized succinct lists html provides tags implementation three majors types lists unnumbered numbered ordered descriptive ll implement first two today leave third reading experimentation n make list classes unnumbered list basic tag lists ul additional tag list item required also might expect tag li make changes follows ul li class li class li class ul o next make list interesting links numbered list using tags ol ol check page using netscape note point problem applying new tags list around tags already used indicate links general number tags applied text long makes sense character formatting rudimentary character formatting abilities provided html won spend much time try experimenting b b tags italic bold text respectively another popular feature ability center text p center level two headers enclosing tags center center venturing onto internet thus far page really hasn accessible anyone probably way want right stored diskette accessible internet since isn running web server change upload copy page computer web server running next activity learn moment however ll keep things simple keep diskette using images finally let add image page images interspersed text called line images types images later special kind tag called img used include tag uses following basic format img src url image let add picture beginning page name first thing need course digitized image kind fortunately easy come image find displayed web downloaded diskette re used see done let get copy furman masthead furman university home page q first use netscape access furman home page http www furman edu masthead image top page get copy simply click using right mouse button hold button menu pop screen select save image presented dialog box like seen navigate web directory save image simple add image page using img tag described r edit index htm include line img src furman gif br right body tag open page using open file netscape check new image note options img tag include align alt former defines image positioned relative surrounding text interspersed latter defines textual substitution image event page read text browser lynx interests time ll omit options today consult html text ask d like know though sources images numerous sources generic images use make pages visually appealing include buttons icons fancy lines backgrounds etc remember anything view using netscape anywhere world downloaded use pages take advantage addition create original digitized images using drawing painting tool finally digitize existing images use scanner accompanying workshop describes make use technology mentioned earlier hypertext links need always text make furman masthead image link furman home page simply including url image inside tag link modify img line added read href http www furman edu img src furman gif test image link using netscape repeat image copying exercise copying interesting separator line image web two good sources http www widomaker com spalmer lines solid index html http www widomaker com spalmer lines textured index html pick one copy directory use replace hr tags horizontal rules file appropriate html line good test whether ve done far makes sense general line images used careful thought cluttering pages many images unattractive source considerable inefficiency trying access page backgrounds suitable images used backgrounds pages make eye catching repositories images found web u access location http www netscape com assist net sites bg backgrounds html select one background patterns copy diskette ve done twice file called background gif change body tag index htm read body background background gif use netscape see effect simple change advanced topics though hopefully laid strong foundation understanding html writing multimedia hypertext web pages today lot html web omitting including use images sounds movies external resources writing fill forms clickable imagemaps incorporating internet tools e mail ftp gopher news along various sundry small features html maybe follow lab cover topics meantime access various html textbooks best teacher web access images pages access html ideas use source option view menu regularly see something interesting would like know accomplish know get look html code see appealing page layout somewhere save copy html source use template filling information appropriate substitute experience experimentation comes learning html ll try build experience afternoon session today hope ll continue explore workshop concludes html editors always web authoring using gory details html described lab already exist several html editors like word processors allow create web pages using see get concept interest creating web pages grows may want check ask finding good editor like information workshop maybe suitable textbook great deal information html web digest lot found web point couple productive directions suggest look following ncsa beginner guide html http www ncsa uiuc edu demoweb html primer html bob allison webmaster page http gagme wwa com boba masters html many others well found two particularly helpful starting points learning process however next putting home page web
