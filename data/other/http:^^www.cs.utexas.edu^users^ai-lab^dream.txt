day dream dream shared many dreamed special kind computer eyes ears arms legs addition brain dream new computer friend would means making money employer help country though loved country still objection making money even dream worthy cause helping poor handicapped world using marvelous new machine dream filled wild excitement seeing machine act like human least many ways wanted read printed characters page handwritten script well could see part small camera would fit glasses attached earplug would whisper ear names friends acquaintances met street telephone allowed converse friend germany german english see computer friend ability recognize faces synthesize voice understand spoken sentences translate languages things like ll admit computer person much larger head envision didn know microcomputers dream computer person liked walk play ping pong especially liked teach things could learn dexterity skills well mental concepts much awoke day dream found didn things remarkable computers even decided quit job set spending rest life helping bring dream reality sometimes forget dream periods life drab recently reporter asked scientists ai research answer well certainly money though wouldn mind rich goes deeper yearning make machines act fundamental ways like people period reminded dream brightened life awhile know fairy tale want see computer prove hard theorems difficult new theorems mathematics recognize faces diagnose diseases reason analogy learn many ways engage intelligent discourse use common sense play good bridge tennis etc etc etc amazing seemed possible know still seems possible really drives course happened buck made ai mind fact economic interest might push forward part needed research believe buck dollar yen frank pound mark lira peso drives us really make happen march different drummer proud part battalion responds music explain dream require mathematician engineer computer scientist want results well almost want surprised even require good science though would probably help overdone dream buck rogers hal starwars r d c po turing test objects third kind jules verne piled one ridiculous things divided like breathing vacuum going faster speed light leaving somehow possible present knowledge science exciting possible generous want actually see things die pressing science along little bit won cut unless part excitement see major milestones physical parts proposed computer person seemed important still excites robot run fall get act autonomously moving companion oh m well aware real problems mind getting computer programs act reason act understand think learn plan enjoy hate etc challenge age happened already believe room talent bring much rest unfolds next years decades let us fail stop occasionally enjoy smell roses thrill new milestone reached began prepare talk wondered would say worth hearing contemplating brought mind thoughts dream things important calling ai researcher years totally kind dream shaky liked shaking running thinking laid aside season language translation sputtered died resurrected facial recognition pushed back researcher stack automatic provers showed signs growing pains disheartened fainthearted machine stepped forward try turing test robot arms duplicating block castles instead playing squash etc etc etc many ai researchers lost faith dropped curiously remained ai fold years also fruitful exciting much proud much left done first foremost learned small child remains ineffective taught given knowledge also machines reasoning alone could enabled prehistoric man even invent wheel matter nimble brain space age woman knowledge wheels gears engines computers aerodynamics like reasoning power discover much knowledge king knowledge key even reasoning enhanced knowledge reasoning knowledge reasoning essence knowledge business ed feigenbaum says working knowledge application machines say every smart program used solve problem regulate chemical process design bridge etc key pieces knowledge built new ai answer ai scientist engineer recognizes knowledge case expert systems plucked program placed separate knowledge base knowledge give power provides functionality knowledge base acts new powerful computer language used programmer carry defines functionality causes actions merely changing knowledge base foremost learned must use knowledge knowledge accumulated mankind last thousand years achieve ai dreams accomplished great deal last years let mention first let express annoyance detractors criticise ai researchers jumping infinity one leap somehow ok work step step dream obtaining controlled thermonuclear energy cure cancer cure common cold step step process allowed trying partially duplicate intelligent behavior human beings cynics natural language system converses us restricted form english somehow legitimate step toward passing turing test know case history science naysayers actually helped new discovery indeed almost ai accomplishments partial kind natural language processors handle subset english french etc systems recognize synthesize limited forms speech character recognition machines read typewritten characters expert systems perform variety tasks human theorem provers prove difficult theorems particular area mathematics handle inferencing needed elementary expert systems including non monotonic reasoning programs play expert level chess programs exhibit elementary level learning reasoning analogy list goes another key thing learned still learning list crucial technologies needed continue pursuit ai objectives partial results mentioned helped unearth roadblocks stand trying go ai beginning enumerate classify enabling technologies foremost list representation storage knowledge added requirement particular design allow learning ease acquiring storing knowledge performance effectiveness using stored knowledge perform tasks solve problems answer questions believe time build large large knowledge bases knowledge base contain common sense knowledge well encyclopedic expert knowledge structured handle learning performance requirements mentioned effort sort headed doug lenat mcc uses common sense knowledge fundamental way uses analogy help knowledge acquisition problem solving believed large structured knowledge base would allow sharing knowledge numerous systems structured correctly could provide much robustness functionality possible number distinct smaller kb said cannot true machine intelligence effective machine learning case way go number good researchers beginning make progress area earlier work machine learning tended ambitious general whereas recent efforts success things learned controlled knowledge structures machine finds values facets within human supplied framework even see real gain reasonable amplification capacity us need rethinking learning analogy process scratch rethinking might also apply areas ai research twenty years ago one might tempted say requires two things build machine appears think like human machine learning natural language understanding machine taught feeding knowledge existing books letting bootstrap higher higher levels mental functionality two requirements formidable indeed fact m afraid characterization misleading lets us believe major present needs ai machine learning might correct principle long run won near term must press areas ai well machine learning example important work speech acts pushed delayed machine learn books carry discourse like marvin minsky suggestion ability program learn proportional already knows program achieved exploited dramatic frightening way causality another important research area ai intelligent programs expert systems begin fail want move shallow statistical rules toward reasoning basic principles several research programs pushing direction believe key move toward basic principles step time basic principles one step example knowledge actions classified levels causality try explain first giving example one holds object hand five feet ground releases fall toward ground fall toward ground increasing velocity fall height y feet governed equation y measured seconds fall according newton law attraction also accounting air friction fall according laws general relativity applications first answer enough release fall example might say child drop rock hurt foot might called shallow level deeper levels give information precise higher cost human could never get anything done operating continuously third level let alone fifth neither could expert system early expert systems tended operate first level causality shallow level fortunate allowed programs exhibit great deal expertise minimum cost successes expert systems great value field ai helped build confidence ai researchers worthwhile accomplishments possible also promised financial returns near term help pay research development operating shallow level bad works problem comes level adequate deeper causal reasoning needed point machines need directed one step deeper causality chain using causality properly mean jumping deepest causal level rather working levels needed believe recent work qualitative reasoning correct step direction make work properly overall knowledge structure governed partly common sense needed control process new super expert systems coming decade absorb large percentage research development effort next several years rightfully mean expert systems endowed large structured knowledge bases ability reason various causality levels preferring shallowest resorting deeper levels needed limited ability learn automatically experience accumulate knowledge analogy truth maintenance systems enhanced human interfacing facilitate knowledge acquisition experts ease use etc super expert systems evolve thinking part opposed moving sensory parts dreamed intelligent machines future later versions enhanced ability learn e g learning directly machine readable text reason analogy much let list areas feel dominate ai research next decade discussed already list one automatic reasoning important research areas large structured knowledge bases knowledge representation knowledge storage retrieval use expert systems technology large effort machine learning controlled knowledge structures causality depth levels human interfacing natural language processing speech recognition generation automatic reasoning analogical reasoning common sense reasoning default reasoning tried complete listing even mentioned important areas robotics automatic programming planning automatic reasoning another area research becoming increasingly important number reasons earlier expert systems required modest inferencing power operated rules shallowest levels reach toward deeper causality reasoning component challenged handle switching levels added complexity deeper levels always knowledge plays crucial role also emergence logic basis programming languages prolog loglisp parlog etc means storing knowledge logic data bases logic based rules expert systems suddenly placed new load automatic reasoning programs provers thus see great interest kilolip machines perform large number logical inferences per second high performance needed horn clause problems use prolog also reasoning first order logic even modal logic higher order logic thus renewed interest automated theorem proving interesting see whether new concepts handling horn clauses first order logic expected produce raw horsepower megalip range enough cope load imposed next generation applications whether methods spiced special reasoning knowledge units speeding proofs particular applications event automatic reasoning research become relevant near future let misunderstood general purpose reasoning machines theorem provers alone enough knowledge still key requirements reasoning knowledge intensified partly satisfied new high speed provers beginning appear great faith ai community headed generally right direction half new crop graduate students admitted ph d program computer science university texas year selected ai preferred field study preference ai seems duplicated throughout world talking best students young people hold hands future discipline power influence earlier pioneers wane new researchers emerge urge new students new researchers set vision future courage make major new departures question old get new much learn us pointed generally right direction major gains yet made personally favor bold approach timid certain bold experiments made one effort mechanical translation mt work early called failure tried seems rather obvious cannot mt without language understanding awareness made much clearer earlier experiments helped focus research important area natural language processing look exciting become led even resurgence mt similar story could told early speech recognition quality speech recognition possible without language understanding early experiments perceptrons represent another example cases lot work compensated somewhat lack great idea shakey robot project sri another example case value early work widely appreciated principle want make looks like good idea give best shot waste little money get early feedback take forever study problem even expensive less exciting course strategy scientific method requires character part researcher must willing analyze experiments reformulate theories press otherwise person qualify work entrusted research funds recently reading thomas edison team time developed successful light bulb started thought good idea plowed ahead brash cocky bragged would build widely usable electric light bulb early ideas wrong believe lucky even brilliance could taken years another example like language translation early expensive failure returned information helped finalize successful solution believe ai position today kinds bold experiments needed bold bragging need conducted men women character wisdom persistence enough succeed another concern flash pan researcher person limited theory trivial application none gets useful feedback builds program cannot surprise way leaves others prove extend work fragment better pretty brilliant anything become likely real researcher rediscover fragment part larger effort absorb credit might recall ai pioneers well known theorized important characteristic good researcher answer good research successful people somehow find way succeed others fail course native intelligence important ingredient alone enough equally important characteristic ability inclination combine theory experiment would say young people set dream set goal part bringing dream tool education employment facilities pursue vigor impatience want today ve never seen content researcher worth salary easily deterred insight training work hard provide momentum give easily spend much time extolling work others never properly recognized satisfied make personal contribution compare compete rules researcher field conviction field ai worth finest efforts told dream offered advice young researchers offered opinion important areas ai research predictions could make one m sure surprised acknowledgement want thank doug lenat mary shepherd clive dawson joe scullion hassan ait kaci elaine rich dick martin dick hill helpful comments title
