encountering comprehensive probably constantly evolving grouped language used list non language specific problems end find want ask consultant consultant e mail perkinst cs wisc edu c common problems using borland ide c language compiler linker errors borland refuses run program runtime errors crashes floating point errors protection faults errors occur program running borland ide problems difficulties program files project files windows screen editor general problems mechanics using borland ide input output errors problems reading input sending output files etc working fortran hint write run programs efficiently miscellaneous problems printing e mail disk quotas c compiler linker errors error statement missing fix click message get highlighted line source file line line immediately ended semicolon lines c code except statements followed compound statements else etc mark end statement error declaration syntax error fix line isn declaring variable problem definitely variable declaration immediately missing semicolon otherwise may still problem may also done something else like missed comma variable names put space variable name variables must one word error unable assign char char fix char variable single keystroke like n note single quotes char variable array characters string like hello note double quotes beginner purposes view entirely different animals particular takes byte memory whereas stored byte containing followed byte containing end string message program seemed nearly working gets sorts errors involving ostreams run linking program without compiling source code click inside cpp window select project compile try running get annoying linker error owlmain chances created opened project must project menu cannot file menu created opened project make sure choose build option project menu chances get many linker errors program source file c extension borland compiler complains attempt compile make c file caused forgetting choose advanced option creating project file easiest way fix problem select source code file name project window know selected highlighted press right mouse button menu pop choose edit node attributes menu produce window allow change default extension file choose cpp saved program source file c extension want resave file cpp extension use save option file menu run time errors program gives weird windows error message run unfortunately wide open problem caused numerous things common problems following trying use pointer points null accessing elements beyond bounds array creating large data structures like dimensional integer arrays local variables functions running disk space etc unfortunately problems exhibit consistent behavior times use interactive debugger figure problem program starts run stops get window tells general protection exception error caused access memory outside legal bounds program often means used array tried access set elements outside array bounds instance array x may asked x x another possible cause error using pointers attempted access pointer yet initialized find error often easiest use debugger trace line code causes memory error programming running get floating point underflow floating point division zero program stops floating point underflow caused uninitialized variables declare floats doubles set value use may start huge tiny values cause errors calculations simple fix initialize floats zero division zero error may obvious look code occur variables unexpected values often performing calculation inside loop loop goes one place far first last iterations form special cases resulting division zero unless spot right away best way find error probably use debugger track offending line code run program use watch feature view variables involved see causes things run afoul borland ide errors see nothing open project open existing project see background borland ide choose project option view menu show project window nothing project window good question could accidental thing fluke way fix select target option project menu easy thing use name project minus ide extension go process creating project try open program file cpp extension get weird message truncating lines another good question likely named project cpp extension default extension project file ide left way unfortunately questionable able get source program back ask consultant attempt salvage code network backups program source file c extension borland compiler complains attempt compile make c file caused forgetting choose advanced option creating project file easiest way fix problem select source code file name project window know selected highlighted press right mouse button menu pop choose edit node attributes menu produce window allow change default extension file choose cpp saved program source file c extension want resave file cpp extension use save option file menu borland c always crashes attempt run fix would recommend ask consultant borland configuration files apparently corrupted input output errors m trying cin getline working run program goes right getline weren common problem problems mix cin cin getline input statements program cin function take input leaves newline character input buffer getline call follow cin getline read single newline character stop appear getline read nothing whenever getline following cin must clear newline character buffer either cin ignore another cin getline course placed cin cin getline really takes input example suffers error cin golfscore cin getline playername max str n case playername would get null string newline character left input buffer cin two ways problem fixed cin golfscore cin ignore max str n cin getline playername max str n cin golfscore cin getline dummy buffer max str n cin getline playername max str n program runs correctly redirecting output file ran program first time worked great run get output first time matter change input problem chance still output file open first time ran program windows basically lock files open windows cannot overwrite contents file remedy close output file printed find output file open choose window menu tell exactly open run program redirect output file output file always empty also redirecting input want check make sure path name file typed correctly path name hard coded program want make sure used two backslashes every one path example following file r public jjason myfile would coded follows program ifstream input r public jjason myfile also make sure copied input file instructor copied correct directory m trying output cout get compiler error telling illegal structure operation cout used print strings numbers want print complex object must use means instance defined class foo may given output method prints internal variables messages class foo public void output want print object students sometimes make mistake making call output member part cout foo fooa cout output function works part cout despite odd notation cout cout working re really difficulties remember consultants lab help hours day keep consultant sign top computer working wear nametags easy spot program doesn give results hoped program runs really strange things help best bet run interactive debugger consultants also able help chances run debugger since one familiar program would one likely spot errors quickly using debugger recommend learning basic features debugger stepping program viewing contents variables fortran little suggestion make productive going program development cycle helps immensely two windows open ms dos prompt one window use editor work program one leave dos prompt compile run program alleviates need exit editor every time want compile program note make sure save program editor attempting compile window miscellaneous run disk space get want use file manager delete files user directory drive u first delete files start letters bc used borland c compiler likely candidates files following extensions exe obj csm bak files easy reproduce word warning get rid files know created created behalf instance compiling program sure delete ask consultant locked account gain access type login password wrong enough times locked network around minutes wait time expired log get message exceeded maximum logins refused access log caused logged one computer make sure logged machines includes

parter type email password wrong enough times kerberos locks entry go systems lab cs st get unlocked free computers lab others use try computers doit lab basement computer sciences building information outside lab get doit lab send job printer never prints wrong two likely causes first print server working second exceeded printer quota whatever problem continue sending files printer know cause problem use check print queues program administration group view run program make sure laser printers selected box next printer names x click box one appear clicking check queues button show list printers documents waiting printed spot print jobs labelled username queue exceedingly long moving inform consultant unix ta may problem printers check print queues program also allows check paper quota clicking check quota button already printed many pages allowed must go computer systems lab pay paper credited account would like forward cs e mail student e mail account possible course want use user util program mentioned log using login id e mail password menu select forward e mail follow directions course assumes memorized student e mail address also use program stop forwarding e mail forwarded e mail would like able check lab possible need go e mail program eudora select special menu select configuration option box labeled pop account type e mail account would like check next part important select special menu time select switches option make sure box marked leave mail server x box selected check e mail lab download mail mailbox user directory means able check e mail
