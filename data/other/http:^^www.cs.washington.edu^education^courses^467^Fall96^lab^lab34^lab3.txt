devices debug synchronous designs using simulation working sometimes rather loosely teams four first part assignment follow tutorial work groups two second part given circuit divides naturally two parts solved individually half team linked together form complete solution note although tutorial rather complete may need look synario manuals lab answer questions may use advanced features tutorial topdown design using abel schematics tutorial design counter counts n n input counter counter composed two component modules simple counter comparator comparator compares endcount current count value causes counter restart note following tutorial exactly let know things diverge ii design problem serial communication construct sequential circuit interfaces simple keypad lcd screen characters printed lcd screen keyed using two key presses one first bit nibble character code one second bit nibble example print one would key circuit design communicate values keypad lcd display using solution homework problem presented method bit serial communication start designing simulating circuit synario next weeks program parts circuit plds plug get circuit work figure shows components system figure keypad first half circuit takes values entered keypad sends serially second half circuit keypad nine wires one column one row common wire connected ground common connection switches key pressed corresponding column row wires connected common signal see figure therefore keypad called wires active low key pressed others pulled high resistor connections v first part task convert bit value keypad wires bit value plus ready bit bit value encodes key pressed binary number followed b c d ready bit synchronized clock asserted high one cycle indicating key pressed rest circuit collect two bit values send serially according protocal across link lcd display circuit also need latch e store register first key pressed wait second might good idea latch done one two lcd screen second half circuit receives data sent bit serially keypad displays value lcd screen display using straightforward interface takes instructions data depending value rs wire table shows instructions using four instructions required initialize display configuration require line character display shown first four lines table control logic must sure issue instructions whenever reset reset need write characters display fifth line table displayed immediately display unit finally hit reset switch start entering new number find character codes display documentation operation rs r w db db clear display function set display entry mode set write character dddd dddd backspace return home read character dddd dddd timing constraints must satisfied writing information display quite straightforward basically display samples rs line rising edge enable signal e db lines falling edge e keep things simple set hold time rs one cycle rising edge e respectively similarly db lines falling edge e timing information importance allow ms display actually clear internal controllers takes time actually go enter internal memory display unit since project need perform read operations r w control line tied directly gnd normal character write operations rs signal execute command rs signal easiest way perform write asserting enable signal e one clock cycle rs data stable must ensure number code stable happening shouldn problem key press takes lot longer circuit need however ensure rs stable cycle write operation performed need controller finite state machine since enable signal used clock data display hazard free spurious glitches easiest way ensure make direct output flip flop pld details details details part designing circuit solve problem defining problem problem descriptions hazy incomplete ambiguous one tasks designing turn description precise specification begin design ask missing write precise specification may save lot work end document parts circuit design preferably using word specifying pieces interact solve part include documentation synario project hand schematics notes forget provide reset input halves circuit figure signal beginning data separate idle time decide good speed clock suits lcd display might well simulate proposed clock speed hint relatively slow entering simulating design divide half design reasonably sized components registers counters combinational logic fit single pld draw top level schematic design including components need work ta sure define hierarchy use abel specify sequential e g counters combinational e g code converter components find useful chip definitions cse directory use schematics first importing creating matching symbol tutorial covers may want standard chips although use plds everything simulate designs separately best combine two projects using new top level schematic start new project import pieces two projects simulate complete design need provide keypad stimulus easy eight inputs need check
