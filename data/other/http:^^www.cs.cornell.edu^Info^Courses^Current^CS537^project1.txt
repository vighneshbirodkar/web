c something familiar start early project projects either predator minibase projects stand alone require neither system would rather predator stand alone projects since learn done cs equivalent introductory database course minibase projects projects emphasis coding according established conventions documenting code code stability e would rather write code things well rather many things unstable fashion choose project th october encourage earlier start projects several groups working project topics also possible try match projects interests background many projects need persons find groups ideal want put group someone else either case early project need identify person going graded individually net result predator projects predator client server dbms built research prototype main research purpose system explore techniques support large number data types extensible manner meaning possible extend system support fields new type like video image without changing system significantly part predator relational database system supporting subset sql course projects either involve extending enhancing sql functionality involve adding support new data type add opt relational query optimizer persons currently predator serious query optimizer instead uses join order provided query project involves incorporating opt optimizer predator opt independent library used customize design query optimizer work involve finding opt integrating predator query evaluation demonstrating query optimization simple join queries develop query plan visualization tool query execution visualization tool persons purpose project build graphical tool displays query plan result query optimization also displays execution plan possibly displaying computation proceeding add path function indexes persons project involves getting good understanding way indexes used query processing path indexes complex indexes implemented top existing simple index functionality predator important object oriented object relational database systems project need provide fully working path index capability specifying index sql recording presence catalogs using index applicable query optimization actually retrieving index run time project give good grasp internals query processing engines evaluate wisconsin benchmark persons wisconsin benchmark industry standard dbms benchmark used measure performance relational dbms project two parts first implement groupby orderby features currently supported predator second execute benchmark try enhance performance whatever extent possible invaluable experience plan work performance related issues real dbms evaluate tpc d benchmark persons tpc d benchmark advanced query processing benchmark functionality benchmark yet predator project involve balance adding functionality benchmark queries run improving performance queries like previous project good exposure practical benchmarks people care implement image data type rivl persons predator already elementary image data type project implement large part support images found rivl brian smith multi media system operations rotate clip overlap etc image implement image data type vision persons predator already elementary image data type project involve interacting ramin zabih incorporate feature extraction algorithms use extracted image features index image data implement video data type persons add video data type support various operations defined rivl brian smith multi media system implement audio data type persons requires knowledge audio data likely operations audio audio data needs added data type along manipulation functions implement text document data type persons add document data type along nlp operations document based claire cardie work require interaction nlp people implement data type chemical molecules persons pharmeceutical companies huge databases chemical molecular structures much research involves searching database d spatial matches molecules project try support molecule structure data type database operations molecule based research paul schuh others done area project involve interactions group build c language embedding predator persons commercial sql system allows queries embedded inside host language like c c cobol etc project build c embedding predator sql integrate external databases predator predator extensibility mechanism allows new query processing engines incorporated system project extend mechanism integrate external databases instance informix server predator ensure multi user functionality person predator client server system implemented multi threaded server however multi user nature system tested several problems project fix problems demonstrate multi user capability build full sql compliant parser upto level type checking transformations persons current version sql small subset ansi standard project make sure ansi standard sql implemented extent parsing type checking persons work query transformations also required project implement materialized views query caching indexed retrieval quite researchers suggested results queries cached later use executing another query project provide portion functionality since ongoing topic research project must go along paper survey topic minibase projects implement b trees implement hybrid hash join sort merge join implement two new buffer replacement policies implement r tree indexes implement hash based sort based aggregation projects build data mining dbms persons upto groups data mining exciting new area blends ai databases idea information patterns hidden database evident instance medical databases various statistical patterns extracted empirical cause effect rules project must go data mining paper survey purpose project implement algorithms suggested literature see perform implement data clustering algorithms persons another aspect data mining see looking classify large amount data groups clusters based properties point efficiently several algorithms proposed literature project involve implementing build standalone system r optimizer randomized optimizer persons query optimization important topic database query processing project build stand alone query optimizer using two three different approaches purpose compare alternatives suggested literature project must go along paper survey query optimization build simple olap line analytical processing system persons olap refined form query processing involves large amount precomputation answers queries typically involve several aggregates answers presented graphically build ole db database components persons ole db protocol microsoft developed top ole com allow multiple databases connect interoperate project involve using protocol build ole db compliant database components built nt using visual c since lot help visual c ta already familiar environment plan take project
