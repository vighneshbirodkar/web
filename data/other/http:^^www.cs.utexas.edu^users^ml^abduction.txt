abductive system lab experimentally evaluated compared learning systems expert knowledge base domain diagnosing brain damage due stroke inductive learning abductive diagnosis cynthia thompson m thesis department computer sciences university texas austin new system learning induction called lab presented lab learning abduction learns abductive rules based set training examples goal find small knowledge base used abductively diagnoses training examples correctly addition generalizing well unseen examples contrast past systems inductively learn rules used deductively abduction particularly well suited diagnosis given set symptoms manifestations want output set disorders explain manifestations present training example associated potentially multiple categories instead one case typical learning systems building knowledge base requires choice multiple possibilities number possibilities grows exponentially number training examples one method choosing best knowledge base described
