communication man machine december harold cliff chaput introduction artificial intelligence debate mainly centered representation problem one side classical ai maintaining intelligence matter symbol processing side usually consists connectionist claiming systems model brain e neural systems likely approach functionality mind white debate continues sputter recent events brought question whether symbol manipulation necessary intelligent behavior becoming clear sophisticated actions accomplished little high level computation sometimes symbolic processing yet also know certain cognition tasks performed symbolically symbol manipulation representative symbols seem necessary component intelligence parts intelligence also appear sufficient creating intelligence missing dialog discussion symbols symbol manipulation come human mind symbols categories emerge cognitive apparatus understand categories relation symbolic thought non symbolic cognition several efforts linguistics cognitive psychology philosophy computer science shed light area reveal aspects link connectionism representationism issues lie heart communication ability convey meaning symbols ability evoke thought without symbols ability translate two communication golden fleece ai connectionist representationist nothing better exposes complexities subtleties intelligence yet remains completely reach perhaps philosophical look communication point way towards possible implementation paper plan discuss issues arose implementing program non symbolic communication robotmap brief overview representational connectionist ai ll talk activity robotics made people think differently problem drawing different fields ll discuss implications ideas cognition communication wrapping look robotmap reveals symbol grounding symbol emergence natural language processing representation style bulk existing artificial intelligence code representational artificial intelligence realized representing problem set symbols computer manipulate find correct optimal solution chess programs sort possible moves look symbols represent future states chess board theorem provers take predicate logic statements fortunately already symbolic form churn manipulation rules find new theorems form novel symbolic constructs symbols computer manipulates necessarily correspond thing problem domain therefore answers arise set symbols translated back problem domain e g chess move new theorem essential design natural language processor computer take sentence break symbols convert symbols internal representation usually representation form predicate logic computer uses derive meaning sentence example take sentence jack kissed jill take know syntactic structure english produce following syntactical analysis np jack vp v kissed np jill looking word kiss kissed past tense lexicon know kiss takes agent kisser theme kissee given information build following predicate logic form past kiss action agent name j person jack theme name j person jill straightforward approach converting sentences predicate logic works great deal success gives computer something analyze manipulate approach quickly ran problems example consider following couplet jane saw bike store window wanted suppose want parser identify antecedent well know word refers animate female object one previous sentence jane assign jane referent parser must include extra information lexicon like gender animacy etc far good well genderless inanimate object three bike store window parser stuck problem people answer little effort might tempted create hack say subject refers subject previous sentence bike hack would fail quite quickly jane saw bike store window pressed nose order parser interpret sentence need tell pressing noses wanting bikes looking store windows etc done scripts describe relationships schank abelson implementation quite daunting order understand natural language unconstrained setting would need armed battery scripts parse simplest texts number scripts needed tremendous exceptions quite numerous illustrate consider parser would make sense following examples teacher billy name color rainbow billy blue teacher good janet name color rainbow janet blue teacher color billy used implication choose another color teheran turkey isn teacher b new york france suppose pope jewish doesn teacher class suck b hmm cubs johnny hey sally let play sonic mother homework coming along johnny problem termed common sense problem solutions problems ambiguity lie knowledge common sense ironically problems easy people understand stopped representational ai tracks currently representational solution problem underway cyc project doug lenat plans catalog common sense set logic statements one cannot help wonder solution natural language understanding convoluted difficult undermining symbols philosophical argument intelligence symbol processing come two major flavors one symbol crunching sufficient describing intelligence position demonstrated searle well worn thought experiment chinese room searle essentially says system translates chinese english would know chinese calculator knows math e claim highly controversial many rejoinders launched purposes useful response knowing something matter degree person memorized wasteland certainly knows poem different way perhaps lesser degree author written biography elliot student th century american poetry way might comfortable idea calculator might know math well argument representational ai knowledge cannot captured set rules particular dreyfus dreyfus claim common sense knowledge particularly prone based whole patterns experience dreyfus dreyfus think closer matter concedes logical approach might work time dreyfuses say mistake think must theory every domain claims proficiency achieved similarity recognition domain see view psychologically supportable provides insight problem researchers computer science looking non symbolic computation since mccullock pitts first considered neurons logic elements mcculloch pitts rosenblatt developed perceptron model rosenblatt saw great success next ten years connectionism sister representation held lot promise excelled problems representation struggled rosenblatt b steinbuch widrow grossberg predictably vice versa approach problem artificial intelligence brought abrupt halt minsky papert perceptrons minsky papert paper forecast inevitable ceiling connectionism convinced generation researchers abandon field interest pick regaining acceptance field computer science lately connectionist systems used model neurology learn complex systems even manipulate symbols chalmers trained neural net takes active verbs inputs produces passive verbs outputs chalmers many would classify symbolic task consequently connectionism come greater scrutiny approach artificial intelligence provides architectural features representation ai lacking namely modelled however loosely human neurophysiology lloyd cautions features brain doesn necessarily make intelligent lloyd similar searle criticism computer brain stuff doesn mean mind lloyd points many systems attributes neural net parallel processing multidimensional inputs outputs non symbolic analog processing view intelligent e g car prevalent complaint connectionist architectures lack symbolic processing capabilities therefore capture symbolic aspects intelligence fodor connectionist systems take symbols input produce symbols output processing symbolic level therefore capture high level aspects brain connectionist researchers taken defensive trying show symbol processing subset connectionist capabilities though argue connectionist systems use completely different approach symbol manipulation mutually exclusive operation provide functionality absent symbolic systems van gelder robot revelation history computational planning problem solving another classic example representational dilemma early stages robotics researches divided problem robotics three areas looking around sensing figuring planning acting time hardware wasn yet available handle sensing acting problems effort concentrated planning understanding sensors would eventually provide information environment symbolic form course actuators would take symbolic instructions perform actions environment sensor actuator hardware became better however performance didn live ai researchers expectations sensors imperfect give noisy ambiguous readings actuators also imperfect making difficult perform simple actions like going straight line turning problematic realization environment imperfect always subtleties sensors either notice unintentionally see contradicting robot internal representation world also environment constantly changing objects like people move around inserted removed robot field perception difficult take contingencies account representationally planning system takes account longer takes anything symbol processing systems robot perform tremendous amount work navigate even simplest environments knowledge bases epic computation times geological something really wrong moving around environment high level symbolic brain function like natural language processing chess something simplest life forms earth perform quickly dead accuracy example imagine watching ant walk along beach might inclined conclude watching complicated circuitous route ant representation world rule set moving must complicated likely explanation ant view world method movement really quite simple complexity behavior could reflection complexity ant environment braitenberg shows intelligent behavior achieved wiring sensors actuators right way planning needed braitenberg example suppose robot two light sensors two motors straight wire sensors motors left sensor left motor etc set electronics light sensor sees faster motor go robot avoids light run away light stand still light move faster light brighter put robot water currents differences water temperatures densities conspire alter robot course convincing make job somebody might mistake robot living thing water braitenberg also notes multiple sensors sense different things multiple actuators move different ways layer different actions operating simultaneously give appearance complex intelligent behavior basis rodney brooks subsumption architecture brooks layered architecture brooks uses build autonomous robots brooks robots consist mostly electronics connecting sensors effectors much like braitenberg postulated method gets impressive behavior little processing power representation one brooks insect robots walk around room climb objects real time without help silicon whatsoever robots use symbolic model world find task exceedingly difficult require large database facts brooks robots sent shockwave artificial intelligence community served wake call computer scientists busy trying represent everything brooks built robots real time took hours could done ai researchers needed reevaluate methods problem realism brooks attributes success rejection representation together feels representational ai untenable founded realism specifically rejects idea meaning derived direct correlation objects real world brooks shows impossible know sure representation system sufficiently reflecting true nature world brooks similar dreyfuses complaint indeed lakoff discusses problem length particular regarding categories lakoff meaning abstract symbols derived correspondence objects real world categories must exist real world order meaningful categories use follow rules logic example gould discusses current problem biology classification gould two camps disagree taxonomy correct cladists interested branching order evolution look shared derived results pheneticists look overall similarity form function traditionalists use results taxonomies studies cases two main taxonomies violently contradict one another like lungfish pheneticists categorize fish cladists categorize elephants cladistic ordering trout lungfish bird mammal lungfish must form sister group sparrow elephant leaving trout stream characters form vernacular concept fish shared primitives therefore specify cladistic groupings point many biologists rebel rightly think cladogram trout lungfish elephant undoubtedly true expression branching order time must classifications based cladistic information coelacanth looks like fish tastes like fish acts like fish therefore legitimate sense beyond hidebound tradition fish unfortunately two types information branching order overall similarity always yield congruent results cladist rejects overall similarity snare delusion works branching order alone pheneticist attempts work overall similarity alone tries measure vain pursuit objectivity traditional systematists tries balance kinds information often falls hopeless confusion really conflict coelacanths like mammals branching order like trout biological role thus cladists buy potential objectivity price ignoring biologically important information traditionalists curry confusion subjectivity trying balance two legitimate often disparate sources information done presents serious problem realism approach deriving meaning lakoff uses make point sentence harry caught fish suppose caught coelacanth phenetic criteria sentence would true cladistic criteria would false objectivism requires absolutely correct answer objectivist rationale choosing one set scientific criteria another isn even reason believe one one objectively correct answer objectivist criterion category common properties objectivist criterion properties count cladists pheneticists different criteria properties take consideration standard independent human interests concerns choose provide unique answer objectivist metaphysics requires objective standard objectivist lakoff means realist requirement knowledge grounded objective view world ayn rand half baked religion taxonomies scientific validity cannot arrive consistent answer without sacrificing benefits one lakoff shows problem crops trying derive meaning categories untapped senses brooks concluded representation red herring feels way build robots perform real world tasks real time completely forsake symbol processing rely entirely sensors actuators world representation often heard say plenty evidence shows underestimated senses pursuit artificial intelligence contemporary developmental psychology talks four change processes occur child matures automatization encoding generalization strategy construction automatization process becoming efficient thought action thus freeing brain activity encoding internally representing objects events terms sets features generalization process mapping known encodings new relations finally strategy construction uses previous three generate rules adapt task demands analysis since generalizations child makes based child encodings child view world much determined senses child encoding sensory information child uses generalizations create rules operating world schema rules clearly based objective view world subjective view view child senses senses organized depends greatly automatization process since efficiency system depends greatly system architecture mind also plays great role symbol creation reber grammar also evidence encoding process continues throughout life person reber demonstrated implicit learning exposing subjects strings generated finite state grammar reber found exposure subjects made good grammar judgements novel strings two groups subjects examine strings told one group develop set rules would explain grammar group told memorize strings reber memorization group better group created rules reber experiment suggests must another process going learning experiment rule formation also suggests process perform rule formation brooks robots hard time performing actions would seem require kind symbolic planning though like following map preparing future obstacles think ignoring symbols entirely brooks another voice connectionist side argument consequently throwing baby bathwater seems clear much higher level intelligence achieved symbol manipulation looking change processes developmental psychology brooks seems focusing automatization process ignoring three even evidence suggest simpler forms life rely symbolic information neurobiologists found called place cells brains rats activate according rats position world independent sensory information muller stead pach ants also found perform navigational tasks would require continuously updating knowledge position gallistel origin symbol manipulation brain symbol grounding communication putnam found formalization semantic theory realism would result inconsistency putnam led wonder true nature meaning result new kind realism called internal realism meaning derived sensory experiences internal realism assumes real world live b concepts world determined sensory apparatus since c people basic physiology d conceptual system based universal foundation ideas world conceptions depend upon biology culture means value free conceptions conceptions something real define kind objectivity objectivity us even metaphysical objectivity god eye view objectivity rationality humanly speaking better nothing conclusion lakoff comes exploration categories metaphor feels create set base level concepts observations given similar physiology people develop nearly base level concepts classic example cross culture psycoanthropological study color berlin kay shows disparate cultures developed congruent models color since base level concepts emerge senses however rely sensory apparatus give meaning example color turquoise understood blue green different sets neurons detecting blue green perceive colors cannot red green since perceived via different responses neurons therefore instead seeing color red green see murky brown internal realism advantage explaining phenomena pure subjectivism doesn purport explain anything avoiding pitfalls present realism also suggests direction building artificial symbol processing systems would act human biological spin mcluhan medium message mcluhan felt medium transmission shaped controlled resultant derived meaning senses certainly mediate communication people receive outside bodies
