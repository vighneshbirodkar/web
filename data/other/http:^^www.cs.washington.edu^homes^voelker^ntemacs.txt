emacs installation emacs used work fine point likely problem due interaction emacs new piece software installed popular culprit seems heapagent due nature emacs designed built emacs fundamentally non

download source define macro ntheap probe base inside procedure src ntheap c allocate heap rebuild emacs ask connect dialup service starts users emacs starts pops dialog connecting dialup service sometimes appears hang minutes suddenly appear reason emacs networking support built emacs starts winsock dll automatically gets loaded tries resolve fully qualified domain name machine name localhost system doesn name mapped try query nameserver internet typically host within isp subsequently prompts connect dialup service ask name server domain name machine know unfortunate anticipated networking support added problem fixed comes work around problem giving dialup support another method figuring domain name machine need edit hosts file system located windir hosts win windir system drivers etc hosts nt localhost becomes alias machine name system doesn hosts file yet easily create one copying sample hosts file directory hosts sam example machine named banana fish cs washington edu would edit

run two different interface modes windows interface allows flexible use mixture fonts colors console interface constrains emacs limitations console windows following two sections describe specify change size position font color attributes emacs interface modes windows interface windows interface change size position font color attributes emacs using three different mechanisms using mouse user interface specifying command line arguments invoking emacs lisp functions probably find convenient specify command line arguments properties shortcut emacs batch file invoke lisp functions startup file information propagate attributes new frames see section frames size user interface resize emacs window drag border mouse command line emacs start particular size invoke x windows geometry command line argument example start emacs window lines columns size use following emacs g x note geometry command combined position command described emacs lisp change size emacs frame using elisp use two functions set frame width set frame height example resize emacs display lines columns could use set frame height selected frame set frame width selected frame position user interface reposition running emacs click title bar drag window command line start emacs particular position invoke x windows geometry command line argument example start emacs pixel offset top left corner emacs g combine size position first specify size position two examples combined follows emacs g x note also specify position offsets corners screen see geometry specifications section x man page complete details geometry command emacs lisp reposition emacs frame using elisp use set frame position function example move current frame offset could use set frame position selected frame fonts fonts emacs named

scratch buffer insert prin string win select font see complete list fonts emacs access execute following elisp code scratch buffer insert prin string x list fonts complete details x windows font names see font names section x man page font support currently little rough around edges particular italic fonts give emacs problems see info using italic fonts generally performs expected occasionally might get unexpected results e g emacs didn quite use font told use work underway fix problems suggest experimenting encounter problems also x windows luxury set font aliases fixed convenient names referring specific fonts work underway provide equivalent alias mechanism win naming fonts cumbersome currently user interface change default font emacs uses shift click left mouse button e shift mouse font selection dialog pop select font would like use click ok button close dialog use selected font note dialog displays fixed pitch screen fonts since emacs cannot handle variable pitched fonts command line start emacs particular font use font x windows command line option example start emacs courier font size font style regular invoke emacs using emacs font courier normal r c ansi emacs

frames using registry entries create value key hkey current user software gnu emacs value name emacs font value type reg sz string courier normal r c ansi since font strings rather cumbersome would suggest cutting font string kill ring place clipboard pasting ctrl v regedit dialog note shouldn place quotes around font string registry emacs frames specific names also specify font frame value name entry use name frame instead emacs e g rmail font rmail frame colors windowing attributes emacs uses x windows color names specifying colors command line elisp one set names set abstract color names e g red green blue names ones typically use arguments command line elisp functions emacs also supports use numeric color names see color names section x man page complete details specify numeric color names color spaces see abstract color names emacs understands colors map use menu command edit text properties display colors invoke list colors display function scratch buffer list colors display would like change mapping color names rgb values add new color names emacs want modify alist win color map make changes simply cons new mappings onto head alist setq win color map cons snow win color map number element logical three values red green blue components b lt lt g lt lt r example red green blue point support reading files color mappings make process little easier user interface change foreground background color emacs windowing interface use menu commands foreground color background color edit text properties menu command line change foreground background color emacs command line use fg bg command line arguments example start emacs yellow text black background invoke emacs using emacs fg yellow bg black emacs lisp use elisp functions change colors emacs faces example change
