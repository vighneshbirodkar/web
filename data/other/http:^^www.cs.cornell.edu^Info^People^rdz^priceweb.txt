zabih cornell university consumers often purchase mass produced items available many different vendors different vendors usually charge different prices easy compare prices consumers would benefit substantially every consumer would able get best price would create economists call efficient market recently expensive make pricing information widely available world wide web cost publishing information fallen dramatically web may possible create efficient market many mass produced consumer items example consider market computer peripherals printers modems etc december cheapest nationally advertised price could find hewlett packard hp c printer expensive price took many hours reading advertisements obtain information several hundred vendors sell mail order peripherals isn easy compare prices several efficient markets exist including stock exchange commodities market items markets hewlett packard stock available single price given time price widely known consumers rarely benefit markets trade consumer goods priceweb experiment together friends cornell begun experiment called priceweb http www priceweb com priceweb attempt create efficient market computer peripherals given peripheral priceweb web site provides list nationally advertised mail order prices listed increasing order makes simple find lowest priced vendor priceweb becomes widely used major impact way computer peripherals purchased mail order vendors would charge single uniform low price unless offer customers additional value computer peripherals sold fairly standardized warranties return policies vendors compete primarily price availability makes product differentiation difficult efficient market vendors would lower prices short term priceweb works advantage consumers disadvantage vendors long term advantages vendors well consumers able buy items without worrying paying argument similar saturn haggling policy new car buyers course prices fall effects lead customers line service like priceweb could additional advantages vendors instance sometimes vendors wish clear inventory selling item cheaply see onsale example line pricing information eliminate delays involved print media advertising thus allowing vendors rapidly adjust prices also internet users monitor pricing information presumably quite price sensitive listing item low price generate large response advantages vendors balanced priceweb negative effects vendor margins negative effects larger consolidation among vendors much would consumers save efficient market one might expect mail order prices peripherals nearly identical aren average price spread items priceweb covers items large price spreads example hp officejet advertised little much vendors wished avoid efficient market would several options instance vendor could sell slightly different items every hp c printer significantly different every hp c printer would impossible compare prices would increase manufacturing costs confuse potential customers thus reducing hp market share effect illustrated american automobile industry years offered enormous range options partly prevent consumers comparing prices japanese offered option packages gave price advantage manufacturing computer industry almost everything mass manufactured due extensive standardization see tno discussion economic impacts standardization option viable opposition manufacturers efficient market could also thwarted punishing lowest price vendor instance suppose higher priced vendors refuse carry hewlett packard printers unless lowest priced vendor forced raise prices hp could turn raise price charges vendor cut vendor completely probably would hp interests importantly actions would violate number laws price fixing robinson patman act excellent overview available federal trade commission laws make illegal manufacturer fix price vendors charge line efficient market would also easier government monitor price fixing efficient markets obvious markets multiple prices example suppose vendor cut prices costs drive rivals business raised prices pattern would fairly easy spot efficient market pricing information available line recent sec investigation nasdaq trading practices motivated academic study pricing trends market data available electronically anti competitive behavior would harder detect challenges number challenges need overcome order create efficient market one potential difficulty concerns updating price information priceweb information comes printed national advertisements market prices change rapidly advertised prices may date appear print obvious solution would use line prices vendor web sites obstacles vendors computability provide line pricing information fact surprisingly vendors web sites also price appears printed ad comes legal protections false advertising guarantees may apply web based advertising even vendors put pricing information line may hard compare prices instance consider andersen consulting bargainfinder helps consumers buy audio compact discs cheaply bargainfinder queries line vendors sell cd via mail order unfortunately vendors currently block bargainfinder accessing sites bargainfinder actively queries line web sites exists pleasure vendors short term may wish cooperate priceweb need become economically self supporting challenge line pricing information economists call public good like example lighthouse notoriously difficult get beneficiaries public good pay addition internet culture makes hard charge users information believe consumers use priceweb pay companies think consumers pay service cybersave shopper example companies correct create market pricing information mark casson chapter information acumen routledge discusses effects markets information efficient market requires perfect information costs associated information fall market become efficient costs associated obtaining pricing information computer peripherals priceweb reduce costs obtaining information instead collects information centrally makes freely available priceweb might viable simply cost running experiment low placing information web page costs almost nothing costs associated gathering entering data also small even small amount revenue advertising instance could make priceweb self supporting addition number services priceweb could provide vendors would provide revenue instance vendors could automatically notified competitor beats advertised price web eliminate retailers web based efficient market could also affect relationship vendors manufacturers manufacturers sell directly customers via retailers retail stores carry products multiple manufacturers customer compare products side side manufacturers attempted protect retailers various means example manufacturer suggested retail price usually quite high every retailer charge less msrp manufacturers protect retailers ensure retailers carry goods growth mail order value provided retailers could diminish may become profitable manufacturers enter mail order business efficient market could eliminate many middlemen efficient market consumer goods would substantial impact society example could eliminate many retail stores favor mail order vendors locate areas low fixed costs could massive consequences many communities downtowns built around retail shopping course consumers shop reasons obtaining lowest price items tylenol savings may small isn worthwhile find best price however large supermarkets spend great deal effort trumpeting small price advantages possible many shoppers price sensitive would prefer efficient market web creates market impact could far greater effects witnessed thus far many retailers might disappear new businesses also come existence instance become much cheaper establish kind specialty businesses traditionally flourish large cities business appeals small percentage population flourish web easily reached potential customers conclusions several experiments web based consumer empowerment similar spirit priceweb one example bbn auto mechanics list profiled rich lethin tno site lists local auto mechanics boston area besides providing names addresses also includes customers comments experiences shop comments summarized moderator provide overall grade repair shop potential customer view comments customers also add comments another example list performs similar service internet service providers like consumer reports sites focus giving consumers useful subjective information web made efficient market consumer goods possible dramatically lowered cost publishing information recently large corporations unusual individuals could reach large audience web changed beginning understand implications
