programming offered fall credits prerequisites knowledge continuous mathematics trigonometry calculus math equivalent introduction elementary computer programming concepts emphasis techniques problem analysis development algorithms programs subject course programming particular programming language principal programming language c course presume previous programming experience programming assignments tested run interactive stand alone microcomputers alternative version com emphasizing examples applications involving continuous mathematics including trigonometry calculus cs b vs cs computer science b basically teaches material cs differences though besides last letter cs b assumes knowledge familiarity continuous math opposed discrete one including trigonometry calculus one might wonder means programming course well computer science math interact many ways cs b introduces one scientific computing mean cs easier cs b means think comfortable integrals derivatives etc cs b show ways applying knowledge computer programming point necessarily test knowledge rather expand apply would like encourage people think would qualify take course continuous math might sound attractive benefit choice often hard find good examples real world problems intro course cs cs b finds one sure whether qualify please talk instructor prof zabih ask opinion besides slight difference
