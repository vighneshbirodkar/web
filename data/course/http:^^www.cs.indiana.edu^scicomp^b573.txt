mathematics whose research involves solving large sparse linear systems computer computer scientists interested learning computational problems encountered scientific engineering codes sparse linear systems occur large scale physical modeling programs often setting solution accounts majority computer time course focus practical methods computer implementation minimal amount underlying mathematical theory high level tools used order quickly implement test methods existing software also used whenever possible avoid building everything scratch learn use existing software resources course goals include ability understand influence computer architecture choice methods data structures strengths weaknesses basic methods common sources large sparse linear systems resulting implications choosing methods implementations students finish semester toolkit solvers use solving scientific problems probing computer architectures obtaining deeper understanding methods commonly used scientific computing tentative course outline quick start everything knew solving linear systems linear algebra course introduction basic linear algebra haven seen sources large sparse linear
