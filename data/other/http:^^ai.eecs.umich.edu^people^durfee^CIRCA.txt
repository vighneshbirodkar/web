ai techniques become mature growing interest applying techniques controlling complex real world systems involve hard deadlines systems controller required respond certain inputs within rigid deadlines system may fail catastrophically example mars rover project requires partially fully autonomous vehicle perform unsupervised navigation hazardous conditions errors could mean loss multi million dollar
