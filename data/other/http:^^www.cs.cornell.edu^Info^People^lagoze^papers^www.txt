xerox inc cornell university abstract goal drop publishing simplify digital publishing internet would like digital publishing non commercial matter e g technical reports course notes brochures easy sending email virtues archival storage easy searching associate electronic libraries propose protocol dienst allow communication clients document servers encoding object oriented messages within url preliminary version protocol runs eight sites describe features next present tools automating maintenance document collections finally discuss problems ve web stands hoping motivate changes would improve performance digital library systems library limits however one may sing praises virtue either defend increase glory country actions affect worldly prosperity within narrow limits aldus building library limits world desiderius erasmus wrote words praise friend aldus book publisher th century years later digital publishing may finally enable us fulfill vision providing universal access world information way existing technologies www gopher even anonymous ftp make reproduction transmission fairly fast cheap little nothing help writers write readers find read documents view problem provide little structure document collection present basically abstraction namely hierarchy files nothing help user locate file within hierarchy every site different group reports year others project name even every site internet organized hierarchy identically would enough every site also conventions naming files indicating data formats making searchable indices writer wishes contribute basically problem easy copy file anonymous ftp area hard make sure indexed properly considerate writer might want provide document several formats increase chances accessibility nuisance claim needed new higher level protocol hides underlying details underlying tools simply library management paper presents first steps towards universal library describe protocol universal access server implements familiar server paper describe currently running protocol rather one submitted internet draft dienstprot corrects number design flaws working version regret confusion causes present number tools integrate server make publishing document line relatively easy also discuss steps took bring large existing collection online paper finally since protocol based world wide web also describe problems ve observed using hope others conference solutions adopt focus non commercial publishing requires explanation realize content providers place intellectual property net clear definitions legal rights mechanisms payment protection place nothing contribute areas nevertheless number providers universities corporate internal groups issues less pressing believe thus make useful contribution without working additional issues raised economics dienst provides uniform protocol document access dienst protocol search retrieval display documents dienst models digital library flat set documents unique name many formats e g tiff gif postscript consists set named parts dienst supports message passing interface document model messages may addressed every document server particular server one document particular part document message encoded path portion url contains name message recipient arguments message may sent convenient dienst server nearest example execute locally forward appropriate dienst appears single virtual document collection hides details server distribution note actual implementation use object oriented language use message passing convenient conceptual model document dienst unique identifier names document location independent manner identifier called docid serves exactly role urn urns fully specified adopt docid three components naming convention publisher number ensure docid unique component rather institution issues component guarantees next component unique thus naming convention controls namespace publishers publisher issues set numbers publisher must least one server handle messages documents issued publisher view minimum commitment publisher must make issue document store deliver document network dienst server receives message document locates closest server document publisher forwards message dienst messages address four types digital library services user interface services present library information format designed human readability repository services store document support retrieval part index services provide search miscellaneous services provide general information server four services first used directly human others used programs particular dienst servers also digital library publishing systems example stanford information filtering tool sift obtains bibliographic records index interface currently designing gateway waters waters system encourage developers digital library systems provide user interface application interfaces systems services except last optional given site allows maximal flexibility way particular server implementations interoperate example one server may exist solely user interface gateway providing transparent access users particular domain indexes repositories see flexible interoperability key development digital library infrastructure collection span multiple sites continents repository servers store documents multiple formats key difference dienst current digital library systems ability represent documents multiple formats current digital libraries present documents exactly one form postscript although postscript almost always available newly produced documents problems relying exclusion formats first older works available paper making scanned page images practical means bringing material online describe experiences second looking forward expect see document representations become popular surely world wide web conference claim html used third reason applications formats better example one wishes full text indexing document collection plain text useful postscript file one wishes display single page collection page images may better searching postscript therefore dienst conceptual data model allows document stored one formats dienst protocol includes message requests document list formats available specify formats mime mime content types dienst support notion explicit conversion document formats system putz repository willing able provide document given format simply list format even obtained conversion service diversity rule internet site supporting dienst likely store documents different way dienst protocol hides detail underlying storage organization sharp contrast ftp gopher bare http underlying hierarchy visible dienst repository includes function maps docid format actual storage pathname server hides details file system structure file typing naming conventions outside users thus one may request say second page tiff version document server without needing know stored index servers support search index server accepts queries query language searches document records satisfy query model index server totally distinct repository repository data likely huge index servers store meta data quite modest size choice query language crucial power index server wish make choice dienst protocol designed one initial query language provision extension support others every query language based underlying model meta data queries initial query language dienst assumes minimal data model documents author title abstract addition publisher number query may refer fields refers one terms connected implicit thus one might query documents published author wilson publisher stanford search request returns document type text x dienst response consisting records containing meta information matching documents meta information follows encoding proposed uniform resource characteristics urc urc urc draft proposes fields title author content type url obviously applicable added number experimental attributes prototype implementation runs eight sites initial version dienst prototype implementation developed part computer science technical report cstr project arpa sponsored cnri directed effort create online digital library technical reports nation top computer science universities version installed five universities form project cornell cmu berkeley mit stanford shortly thereafter princeton dartmouth rochester describe features full account may found dienst one uses dienst connecting convenient dienst server supports user interface services using standard web client server display form searching collection unless user restricts search single publisher dienst servers searched parallel dienst server made aware dienst servers fetching list servers single central meta server thus new server comes online servers become aware short time results search displayed list docid author title date matching document include url document selecting one displays document detail including list available formats obtained described user retrieve document formats repositories include page images bit dot per inch gif files case user interface service able display document page time inline user web client found pages readable monitors saves considerable network bandwidth compared dpi tiff images addition sites also store reduced size thumbnail page images allow user quickly browse document click view interesting page say one contains graphic full page version although formal user studies anecdotal evidence says powerful helpful feature server also allows user download print selected pages document local users may print directly remote users download postscript version document print manually since documents available postscript server ability translate tiff images level postscript fly maintaining document collection goal simplify process author publishes digital documents much work area document creation layer enhancements html html editors approach allow authors use traditional text production system latex troff word etc provide tools submit results text processing digital library dienst simplifies digital library maintenance digital library technology propagate beyond technologically savvy systems require minimal human intervention especially trained experts two points obvious first authors concerned primarily writing documents getting published submission digital library require little skill using word processor second many organizations wish publish documents e g government agencies academic departments small companies little technical expertise organizations might tolerate need reasonable skill level install digital library system intend address skill level required install digital library system future work however surely tolerate cost systems expert maintain library cornell implemented set tools mostly automate process managing digital library tools closely integrated dienst digital library server similar spirit implemented wide area technical report server waters system known techrep whereas techrep designed maintain centralized index unstructured ftp based document repository characteristic waters tools described tailored distributed indexes structured repositories characteristic dienst design goal make digital library maintainable document librarian dl relatively low level computer training dl serves four major roles general manager collection reviewer document submissions protect counterfeit document submissions clearing house copyright issues archiver document hardcopy system recently installed cornell computer science department means technical report submissions authors add documents html form submitter prepares document submission producing postscript representation rather plethora document formats variety word processors

begun use automated system computer science department cornell later time evaluate effectiveness system special attention payed number documents require special submission procedure e translatable postscript obviously ratio high number submitted documents need rethink design system digitizing existing documents mostly manual task describe system almost complete automation document submission process cornell faced additional task converting existing collection digital form tools described useful task large amount manual intervention required cornell computer science department publishing technical reports since september department published tr average length thirty six pages total pages digital record many tr either non existent easily available format difficult interpret current

degree rotation dpi tiff image due incorrect scanning orientation take thirty minutes reasonably equipped sparcstation example illustrates difficulty correcting scanning problems discovered scanning complete many older tr scanned pages oriented landscape mode two pages side side result tiff file containing two page images made correct page mapping impossible document server easy find files problem reading height width tiff header publically available tiff package leffler reasonably quick correction required handcrafting c code split files even handcrafted code location correction process took week compute time powerful workstation addition manual scanning documents also manually enter rfc bibliographic files would easy write translators rfc common bibliographic formats bibtex refer etc consistent electronic bibliographic format available tr web imperfect document viewing technology basing system world wide benefits shortcomings obvious benefit wide availability publically available browsers shortcoming html http web browsers lack number features important digital document display navigation section enumerate features goal inspiring discussion enhancement technologies

internet mail extensions mime although http uses mime typing allow browsers map proper viewer document documents allowed single mime type multipart mime one facility multi format documents ability embed images either gif x bitmap html document yet gross inefficiency problems image embedding since http browser must initiate http get message embedded image document many embedded images lead unacceptable document download times furthermore types one might like embed documents example mpeg clips ability display line tiff images among many digital image formats gif jpeg pbm etc tiff flexible extensible tiff specification constantly evolving latest revision finalized tiff significant evolution standpoint reducing network bandwidth image transfers growing number compression schemes tiff images ability display line tiff images html documents would take full advantage rich de facto image standard permit immediate display images produced scanners fax machines paint photo retouching programs without computationally expensive conversion gif format arbitrary rectangle section client viewing document images web would greatly enhanced user client able select across arbitrary rectangle image transmit selected coordinates back server server could retransmit zoomed image selected image higher resolution available often high resolution tiff image image zooming important feature image viewed document page contains figures tables small fonts client feedback display capabilities main contribution dienst supports notion multiple formats document user select among available formats use view appropriate format would prefer server end chose best format display respective client would possible client http request contained information display capabilities client system especially display depth size authentication ability restrict able access document essential feature production digital library system intended non commercial publishing limiting access required even domain say example documents read members campus community employees corporation require server able guarantee identity making protocol requests summary described system dienst simplifies document publishing internet system makes two important contributions first dienst provides uniform protocol search retrieval display documents protocol addresses flexible document model document unique name multiple formats consists set named parts parts physical pages logical chapters tables addition protocol allows full interoperability distributed digital library servers result user sees single virtual document collection second dienst provides set tools permit easy management digital library tools automate document submission permit document librarian manage collection facilitate production archival hardcopy plan next year build technology number ways installation digital library server difficult intend implement tools auto configure server search engine current implementation primitive intend include advanced search engines example full text search make document discovery collection powerful easier current strategy conducting parallel search servers scale large number servers intend use meta information individual document servers improve search strategy facility one could example choose search libraries high probability containing computer science
