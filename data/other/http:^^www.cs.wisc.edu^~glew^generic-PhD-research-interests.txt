section high level indicating true breadth interests section specific level propose ph d research almost embarrassed admit degree abstraction theoretical nature things discuss section mention mainly show boring drone one track mind incapable understanding contributing fields one specializing section propose particular plan research great hope productive however since necessary balance abstract ideas research interests practical details graduate school professional career section provide brief autobiographical sketch hope background may help explain wish achieve things setting give credence likelihood achieving autobiographical sketch graduated mcgill university b eng electrical engineering worked programmer computer graphics company formic operating systems development group gould performance analysis company manufactured computers motorola completed m university illinois professor wen mei hwu although master thesis topic multiprocessor cache protocols bulk research order speculative cpu microarchitectures starting work intel got chance apply cpu microarchitecture research actually begun undergraduate mcgill carried university illinois one five principal architects p called pentium pro microprocessor p one first still aggressive order speculative microprocessors p processor project completed decided complete ph d research suspended five years ago also entering new role intel first member microcomputer research labs intel architecture group although competing ph d necessarily takes priority hope perform balancing act academic research industrial research goals graduate study professional career goals graduate school follows specific area mind research advanced cpu microarchitectures hope ph d research relevant earlier work designs investigate practical enough influence design computers industry completion ph d e hope research influence design computers shipping years open topics described interests section section obvious autobiographical sketch section already well established professional career occasionally accused overly theoretical academic analyses problems computer design sensitive dictum teach research think successful role p disproves long term wish continue leading edge work computer design initially industry also perhaps academic setting stay intel career goal become intel fellow technical seniority sufficient influence direction corporation however plans become exclusively manager hand considering returning university teach research perhaps native country canada always hope keeping industrial contacts increase chances performing relevant research research interests section describe one particular area interested research though section describe broad areas interest describe motivation succinctly section seen although chosen particular practical area applied experimental research computer architecture interests general motivation want make computers faster want make computers faster relieve humans intellectual drudgery want make inexpensive computers faster fast enough support natural modes interaction users want make inexpensive computers fast enough non computer literate people like parents use want make computers faster fast enough artificial intelligence reasonably studied without constraints insufficient computing resources think study computers produces insights intelligence structures mathematical logical systems moment contribution make computers faster eventually interested working areas knowledge broad high level overall interested augmentation human intelligence using computers interested enough already topic mind would consider applied research developing software thinking tools agents improved ways representing human knowledge yet unachieved ideal vannevar bush memex hypertext system became obvious first encountered issues user interface major obstacle truly creating tools augment human intelligence hence interest d graphics virtual reality speech handwriting recognition mid started career obvious one greatest obstacles improved user interfaces thinking tools lack computational power therefore spent career date improving computer systems performance one day user interfaces wish use cheap ubiquitous similarly fact computer systems provide real time responsiveness even computationally capable obstacle human interaction computers hence involvement real time operating systems design software developer provision hardware prerequisites providing real timeliness hardware developer remain interested incorporation time criterion computer systems primarily software design much sense hard real time sense compile program giving best code produce half hour although chief focus computer design remained somewhat involved first two areas research investigating computer enhancements increase performance areas specifically also involvement intel natural datatypes technical committee case interests insufficiently abstruse also admit continued interest sociology economics specifically market imperfections seem closely related issues cost computation also theory imperfect incomplete systems logical algorithmic however order make progress life one must focus propose focus areas described section specific research focus area propose research primary focus last ten years increasing performance computers facilitate applications thinking user interface describe specifically interest increasing computing power available average member society although worked supercomputer manufacturer research capacity concerned techniques applicable supercomputers although many supercomputer techniques relevant mass market microprocessors us use many fact moment mass market microprocessor design investigating many techniques old supercomputer manufacturers never considered specifically propose research uniprocessor single cpu performance think research multiprocessors inappropriate think lot headroom improvement single cpu performance furthermore may become obvious detailed explanation research interests style cpu microarchitecture propose investigate may also serve bridge uniprocessor multiprocessor cpu design basic problem modern computer design speed cpu increasing faster speed memory also economics memory dram market tend prohibit parallel interleaved memory subsystem techniques used traditional supercomputers increase performance although techniques eventually applied gap cpu memory performance growing basic approach investigate extremely aggressive advanced cpu microarchitectures extending order speculative dynamic execution far beyond currently implementing hope creating large pool possible memory references use existing limited memory bandwidth efficient manner possible techniques currently mind include microarchitecture following list techniques starts aggressive ending techniques little bit beyond present state art industry skip ahead modern cpus execute instructions parallel order continue fetch instructions largely sequential manner rather looking ahead sequential instruction stream propose skip ahead fetch discontiguous instruction packets example propose microarchitectures determine subsequent procedures independent fetch execute procedures parallel related research includes general topic multithreading advocated tera computers also multiscalar research carried guri sohi wisconsin however researchers posit explicitly parallel instruction set also consider see optimistic techniques applied equally well existing instruction sets seeking parallelism implicit existing single threaded program e rather micro scale parallelism present cpu designs macro scale parallelism true multiprocessors propose investigate meso scale parallelism hope designs might allow gradual evolution true multiprocessing hence overcoming market barriers hindered multiprocessing real life therefore envisage computer systems micro scale parallelism taken advantage dynamic execution techniques coworkers employed p pentium pro processor meso scale parallelism taken advantage skip ahead mechanisms describe macro scale parallelism taken advantage explicit multiprocessors convergent code also known minimal control dependencies tjaden flynn seminal paper based observation much time modern processor speculative branch execution work close endif part independent path goal avoid needlessly throwing useful work away incremental selective speculation recovery fact theme avoiding needlessly throwing correct work away extended forms speculation branch prediction data speculation joyful synergy found general mechanism solving problem also seems solve problems convergent code skip ahead processing eager execution finally consider eager execution executing sides branch however since something already verge implemented industry since research date shows benefits mixed introducing extra memory traffic due executing unneeded paths undesirable memory starved processor model mind consider eager execution ancillary techniques already mention however mechanisms support previous techniques also support eager execution would foolish investigate instruction set design finally betters intel encouraging investigate possible new isa paradigms better matched modern microarchitecture risc instruction sets well matched simple pipelined processors early vliws well matched processor designs early possible new style instruction set may better matched order speculative processor designs present perhaps memory starved processors future always keep possibility new instruction set principles back mind also take care resist succumbing temptation easily often found however designing new instruction set features useful technique since new features designed devise equivalent way implicitly predicting performing function hardware without new instruction set features conclusion conclusion therefore interests broad plan focus single area applied experimental research computer architecture believe area relevant industry also challenging enough warrant ph d header u g l glew public html rcs generic phd research interests html v glew exp
