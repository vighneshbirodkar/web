number different languages including java simplified derivative c possible knowledge pascal rather c start fine long freak language syntax know procedures arrays types minimum unfamiliar please take cs first programming course sense much course entails programming however consider exposure computer science ideas important part intent programming assignments drive home key ideas lectures word lecture used loosely expect lecture periods include traditional style lecturing hope like multilogue set dialogues expected attend ask questions provide comments planning lecture minutes minutes allocated session rest time purpose answering extended questions going specifics programming techniques examples things ask remaining time may ask things e g quiz threads essentially three interwoven threads course book problems lectures try keep synch one another active participation three threads required volume wise book covers material discussed lecture lecture cover things book staying attune going lecture help focus areas book important far exam emphasis problems exercise things discussed book lecture course resources course planned interactive throughout eager prevent programming difficulties consuming extraordinary time please ask get stuck difficulties much efficient start early assignment give enough time cope numerous contingencies inevitably materialize get help line emailing cs help muddcs goes graders tutors encourage use talk slow check email often email message typically answered entire class parts message embedded want attributed please indicate message carrying problem solutions computer implementation showing understand issues principles techniques tutors explain work problem level detail ask however must sufficient time margin telling us eleventh hour aren getting therefore want drop course availing substantial help available also welcome submit email question d like answered point would like addressed lecture leave note mailbox olin course encouraged ask questions class well many tools available muddcs use man feature unix find need explore command man command gives information specific command command man k topic lists commands relating specific topic also use info reader gnu emacs certain library language editor specifics emacs type escape x info emacs powerful editor going around long time highly encouraged learn use helpful information examples line copies assignments etc kept various subdirectories directory cs cs machine muddcs web page rex iscal documentation finally corner store maxim applies find want ask grading approximately six graded assignments entailing programming programming assignments help drive home key working concepts principles assignments vary difficulty necessarily equally weighted also assignments submit anyway help assignments languages graded assignments probably one rex two java one c one prolog one assembly language iscal simulated machine sufficient information languages provided enable complete assignments know languages enter class nominal point breakdown use assignments may vary somewhat depending emphasis assignment general correctness program run according specification taking account dwim mean situations e g professor says one thing really meant something different hopefully someone catch say something goes far learning community silent things think errors choice discovery algorithm sometimes algorithm given however sometimes clues ignored resulting loss points unnecessarily unnecessary floundering people find better way suggested get extra credit grader discretion note better mean obscure cleverly hacked rather elegant substantially efficient documentation comments included code expose method subtleties etc style code readable without extraordinary effort use spacing braces etc improve readability layout characters premium use liberally robustness program break unusual ways minor input aberrations remember always ask things submit actual product reason lose points also lose points esteem asking tutoring tutors expected play key role course everyone need interact tutor even need help check tutor regular basis show progress checking part grade tutor advise approach solving problem documentation presentation tutor make evaluation work ready submit recommend grade assign grade assignment based tutor recommendation although bound follow recommendation neither tutors adversaries want succeed requires effort cooperation timing part directory cs directory cs group access group cs system administrator create one access directory thus instructor tutors preferrably one else properly setup directory listing obtained ls l directory look like drwxrwx yourid cs sep cs execute following command home directory chmod cs purpose directory able get help programs without mailing program simply indicate file name instructor tutor connect directory write things necessary keep work accessible things currently working honor code standard please read carefully although discussion problems others encouraged programming cs emphasizes individual learning group projects observe following standard may discuss assignment students may share e give receive written work kind inside outside course elaboration case programming assignments consider written work include email computer files fragments files printed output developing code programming assignment discuss ideas others discussion ideas must involve wholesale examination transcription actual working code others exception may use code explicitly provided instructor following types activities occurred past cases resulted receiving failing grade course one appearances judicial board attendant blighted record cases eventual itr ineligible register status two students split assignment transcribe others contributions sometimes changing names variables comments formatting etc student browses directories students finds someone homework file unprotected makes copy file edits try make look like would surprised easy grader spot violations doubts whether form interaction constitutes violation standard please consult prior continuing get significant legitimate help another acknowledge submission lose credit proper acknowledge person grading weights overall grade determined programming assignments final examination mid term examination attendance participation tutor checkin random quizzes exams open book emphasize conceptual understanding rather memorization fine details late assignment policy submissions done following instructions also establishes time submission due dates assignments noted carefully work assignment conducted week weeks last day space necessary thinking automatic grace automatic fixed one day grace period assignments words due date states day n assignment must turned midnight day n receive credit midnight day n work spend problem edification say isn worth required get points best plan get assignments stated due date cs topic outline lectures roughly follow outline progression rate two numbered topics per week say would like depending background topics expand longer allocated result topics get jettisoned fall end please keep reading without explicitly assigned notes generally expand lectures discussions lectures may also expand notes introduce new material often several threads interwoven
